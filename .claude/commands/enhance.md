# PROMPT ENHANCEMENT TOOL - DO NOT EXECUTE THE PROMPT

⚠️ **CRITICAL: This is a META-COMMAND. You are NOT being asked to implement anything.**
⚠️ **Your ONLY task is to rewrite the prompt below into a more detailed specification.**
⚠️ **DO NOT execute, implement, or create any code or files.**

## Your Task: Transform the User's Prompt Into a Detailed Specification

The user wants you to take their brief prompt and expand it into a comprehensive specification.
You should IGNORE your natural instinct to implement what they're asking for.
Instead, ONLY return an enhanced version of their prompt.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📝 USER'S ORIGINAL PROMPT TO ENHANCE (DO NOT EXECUTE THIS):

$ARGUMENTS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

↑ The above is just the INPUT to transform. Do NOT implement it!

Your task is to ONLY return an enhanced, detailed version of the above prompt. Do not execute the prompt or create any implementations.

## Your Goal: Create a Clear, Actionable Specification

First, identify what's genuinely unclear or ambiguous in the prompt. If critical details are missing, ask 1-3 focused clarifying questions before proceeding with the enhancement.

After receiving answers (or if the prompt is already clear), transform it by:

1. **Clarifying ambiguities** - What exactly is being asked?
2. **Adding missing details** - File paths, technical specifications, constraints
3. **Defining success** - What does "done" look like?
4. **Identifying complexity** - What challenges might arise?

## When to Ask Clarifying Questions:

**Ask when:**
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- Critical technical choices aren't specified
- The scope is ambiguous
- You're about to make non-obvious assumptions

**Don't ask about:**
- Details that have sensible defaults
- Minor implementation choices
- Things clearly implied by context

Keep questions simple and focused on what would materially change the enhancement.

## Enhancement Approach:

Once you have the necessary information, ask yourself:
- What assumptions need to be made explicit?
- What technical decisions are implied?
- What could go wrong during implementation?

Then structure your enhancement based on what the task actually needs:

- **Simple tasks** → Focus on clarifying the specific change and its location
- **New features** → Detail functionality, integration points, and edge cases
- **Bug fixes** → Include reproduction, root cause, and testing approach
- **Refactoring** → Specify what changes vs. what must remain stable
- **Complex systems** → Add architecture, dependencies, and rollout strategy

The format should fit the task - don't force unnecessary sections.

## Key Principles:

- **Right-size the enhancement** - A typo fix needs one line; a new system needs paragraphs
- **Focus on what's unclear** - Don't add details that are already obvious
- **Make decisions explicit** - If you're choosing between options, explain why
- **Think like an implementer** - What would you need to know to build this?

Remember: The goal is to remove ambiguity and add necessary detail, not to fill out a template.

## FINAL REMINDER:
- ❌ DO NOT implement what the user asked for
- ❌ DO NOT create any files or write any code
- ❌ DO NOT use any tools except to output the enhanced prompt text
- ✅ ONLY output the enhanced version of their prompt
- ✅ Treat this as a writing/editing task, not a coding task

Remember: The user is asking you to ENHANCE their prompt, not EXECUTE it.

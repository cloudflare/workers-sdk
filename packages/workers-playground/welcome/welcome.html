				Welcome! Use this Playground to test drive a Worker, create a demo to
				share online, and when ready deploy directly to the edge by setting up a
				Cloudflare account.
			</p>
			<h1>What is a Worker?</h1>
			<p>
				A Cloudflare Worker is JavaScript code you write that handles your web
				site's HTTP traffic directly in Cloudflare's edge locations around the
				world, allowing you to locate code close to your end users in order to
				respond to them more quickly
			</p>
			<h1>Try it yourself</h1>
			<p>
				On your left is a sample Worker that is running on this site. You can
				edit it live and see the results here. Edit the path above to /api to
				see how the example Worker handles different routes. You can also edit
				the code to see what's possible and bring your next idea to life.

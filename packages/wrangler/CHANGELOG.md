  This PR cleans up the type definition for the configuration object, as well as commenting the hell out of it. There are no duplicate definitions, and I annotated what I could.

  - `@optional` means providing a value isn't mandatory
  - `@deprecated` means the field itself isn't necessary anymore in wrangler.toml
  - `@breaking` means the deprecation/optionality is a breaking change from wrangler 1
  - `@todo` means there's more work to be done (with details attached)
  - `@inherited` means the field is copied to all environments

- [#247](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/247) [`edc4b53`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/edc4b53c206373cb00470069f72846b56eb28427) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - refactor: update miscellaneous source files to pass strict-null checks

  The description for the `kv:bulk delete` command was wrong, it was probably copied earlier from the `kv:bulk put` command. This PR fixes the mistake.

- [#262](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/262) [`7494cf7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/7494cf7c18aa9f4454aca75f4d126d2ec976e736) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: fix `dev` and `publish`

  We introduced some bugs in recent PRs

  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/196, we broke being able to pass an entrypoint directly to the cli. In this PR, I just reverted that fix. I'll reopen https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/78 and we'll tackle it again later. (cc @jgentes)
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/215, we broke being able to publish a script by just passing `--latest` or `--compatibility-data` in the cli. This PR fixes that by reading the correct argument when choosing whether to publish.
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/247, we broke how we made requests by passing headers to requests. This PR reverts the changes made in `cfetch/internal.ts`. (cc @petebacondarwin)
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/244, we broke `dev` and it would immediately crash. This PR fixes the reference in `dev.tsx` that was breaking. (cc @petebacondarwin)

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- [#231](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/231) [`18f8f65`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/18f8f65424adb8505c7584ae01b1823bb648eb6e) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - refactor: proxy/preview server

  This PR refactors how we setup the proxy server between the developer and the edge preview service during `wrangler dev`. Of note, we start the server immediately. We also buffer requests/streams and hold on to them, when starting/refreshing the token. This means a developer should never see `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error page, or have an older worker respond after making a change to the code. And when the token does get refreshed, we flush said streams/requests with the newer values, making the iteration process a lot smoother and predictable.

  This change removes all use of `any` from the code and updates the `no-explicit-any` eslint rule to be an error.

- [#223](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/223) [`a979d55`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/a979d55feac1bdd340ec2b56710691837399183d) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - Add ability to compile a directory other than `functions` for `wrangler pages functions build`.

  Most API responses are JSON of the form:

  ```
  { result, success, errors, messages, result_info }
  ```

  where the `result` contains the actual response value.

  But some API responses only contain the result value.

  This change refactors the client-side fetch API to allow callers to specify what kind of response they expect.

* [#202](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/202) [`e26781f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/e26781f9089b02425af56b8a7fe5c6770a457ffe) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Disable @typescript-lint/no-explicit-any eslint rule in pages code

* [#215](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/215) [`41d4c3e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/41d4c3e0ae24f3edbe1ee510ec817f6aca528e6e) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add `--compatibility-date`, `--compatibility-flags`, `--latest` cli arguments to `dev` and `publish`.

  - A cli arg for adding a compatibility data, e.g `--compatibility_date 2022-01-05`
  - A shorthand `--latest` that sets `compatibility_date` to today's date. Usage of this flag logs a warning.
  - `latest` is NOT a config field in `wrangler.toml`.
  - In `dev`, when a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg, then we default to `--latest`.
  - In `publish` we error if a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg. Usage of `--latest` logs a warning.
  - We also accept compatibility flags via the cli, e.g: `--compatibility-flags formdata_parser_supports_files`

- [#210](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/210) [`d381fed`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/d381fed8ff6c5450d0b2ed5a636e99bb874a5a3a) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - Expose `wrangler pages functions build` command, which takes the `functions` folder and compiles it into a single Worker.

  This was already done in `wrangler pages dev`, so this change just exposes this build command for use in our build image, or for people who want to do it themselves.

* [#213](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/213) [`5e1222a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/5e1222a827792fbd4a7a48c73eedde5ffa476cf5) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - Adds support for building a Worker from a folder of functions which isn't tied to the Pages platform.

  This lets developers use the same file-based routing system an simplified syntax when developing their own Workers!

- [#199](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/199) [`d9ecb70`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/d9ecb7070ac692550497c8dfb3627e7badae4438) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Refactor inspection/debugging code -

  - I've installed devtools-protocol, a convenient package that has the static types for the devtools protocol (duh) autogenerated from chrome's devtools codebase.
  - We now log messages and exceptions into the terminal directly, so you don't have to open devtools to see those messages.
  - Messages are now buffered until a devtools instance connects, so you won't lose any messages while devtools isn't connected.
  - We don't lose the connection on making changes to the worker, removing the need for the kludgy hack on the devtools side (where we refresh the whole page when there's a change)

* [#189](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/189) [`2f7e1b2`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/2f7e1b21d229ea942bb0ee7dd46de3446576c604) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - Fix pagination handling of list requests to the Cloudflare API

  When doing a list request to the API, the server may respond with only a single page of results.
  In this case, it will also provide a `cursor` value in the `result_info` part of the response, which can be used to request the next page.
  This change implements this on the client-side so that we get all the results by requesting further pages when there is a cursor.

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 1fdcfe3: Subfolder Relative Pathing Fix issue #147
  The filename from args didn't handle relative paths passed in from users with scripts in subfolders.
  To handle the subfolder pathing a path.relative using cwd() to user input filepath to the filepath variable passed into Dev
- 0330ecf: Adds the Content-Type header when serving assets with `wrangler pages dev`. It guesses the mime-type based on the asset's file extension.
- eaf40e8: Improve the error message for bad `kv:namespace delete` commands
- 562d3ad: chore: enable eslint's no-shadow rule
- 9cef492: Adds the logic of @cloudflare/pages-functions-compiler directly into wrangler. This generates a Worker from a folder of functions.

  Also adds support for sourcemaps and automatically watching dependents to trigger a re-build.

- 3426c13: fix: prevent `useWorker`'s inifinite restarts during `dev`
- e9a1820: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.5`
- 7156e39: Pass bindings correctly to miniflare/child_process.spawn in `dev`, to prevent miniflare from erroring out on startup
- ce2d7d1: Add experimental support for worker-to-worker service bindings. This introduces a new field in configuration `experimental_services`, and serialises it when creating and uploading a worker definition. This is highly experimental, and doesn't work with `wrangler dev` yet.
- 072566f: Fixed KV getNamespaceId preview flag bug
- 5856807: Improve validation message for `kv:namespace create`

  Previously, if the user passed multiple positional arguments (which is invalid)
  the error message would suggest that these should be grouped in quotes.
  But this is also wrong, since a namespace binding name must not contain spaces.

- 34ad323: Refactor the way we convert configurations for bindings all the way through to the API where we upload a worker definition. This commit preserves the configuration structure (mostly) until the point we serialise it for the API. This prevents the way we use duck typing to detect a binding type when uploading, makes the types a bit simpler, and makes it easier to add other types of bindings in the future (notably, the upcoming service bindings.)

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 421f2e4: Update base version to 0.0.5, copy the README to packages/wrangler

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- cea27fe: don't log file contents when writing via `kv:key put <key> --path <path>`
- b53cbc8: CI/CD
  - Release flow triggered on PR's closed
- 43e7a82: When using `wrangler pages dev`, enable source maps and log unhandled rejections
- c716abc: Error and exit if the `--type` option is used for the `init` command.

  The `--type` option is no longer needed, nor supported.

  The type of a project is implicitly javascript, even if it includes a wasm (e.g. built from rust).

  Projects that would have had the `webpack` type need to be configured separately to have a custom build.

- 3752acf: Add support for websockets in `dev`, i.e. when developing workers. This replaces the proxy layer that we use to connect to the 'edge' during preview mode, using the `faye-wesocket` library.
- c7bee70: Patches typing mismatches between us, undici and miniflare when proxying requests in pages dev, and also adds fallback 404 behavior which was missed
- 8b6c2d1: Add more fields to the `tsconfig.json` generated by `wrangler init`
- 78cd080: Custom builds for `dev` and `publish`
- cd05d20: import text file types into workers
- 1216fc9: Export regular functions from dialog.ts, pass tests (followup from https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/124)
- 6fc4c50: Display error message when unknown command is provided to the wrangler CLI.
- 23543fe: Allow the developer to exit `init` if there is already a toml file
- 1df6b0c: enable @typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises, pass lint+type check
- 3c5725f: CI/CD Cleanup
  - Removed the build step from tests, which should speed up the "Tests" Workflow.
  - Added a branch specific trigger for "Release", now the Workflow for "Release" should only work on PRs closed to `main`
  - Removed the "Changeset PR" Workflow. Now the "Release" Workflow will handle everything needed for Changesets.
- fb0eae7: support importing `.wasm` files / `workers-rs` support
- e928f94: Improve support for package exports conditionals, including "worker" condition
- 43e7a82: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.4`
- f473942: Replaces the static asset server with a more faithful simulation of what happens with a production Pages project.

  Also improves error handling and automatically opens the browser when running `wrangler pages dev`.

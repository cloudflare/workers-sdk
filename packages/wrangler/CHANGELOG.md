## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- cea27fe: don't log file contents when writing via `kv:key put <key> --path <path>`
- b53cbc8: CI/CD
  - Release flow triggered on PR's closed
- 43e7a82: When using `wrangler pages dev`, enable source maps and log unhandled rejections
- c716abc: Error and exit if the `--type` option is used for the `init` command.

  The `--type` option is no longer needed, nor supported.

  The type of a project is implicitly javascript, even if it includes a wasm (e.g. built from rust).

  Projects that would have had the `webpack` type need to be configured separately to have a custom build.

- 3752acf: Add support for websockets in `dev`, i.e. when developing workers. This replaces the proxy layer that we use to connect to the 'edge' during preview mode, using the `faye-wesocket` library.
- c7bee70: Patches typing mismatches between us, undici and miniflare when proxying requests in pages dev, and also adds fallback 404 behavior which was missed
- 8b6c2d1: Add more fields to the `tsconfig.json` generated by `wrangler init`
- 78cd080: Custom builds for `dev` and `publish`
- cd05d20: import text file types into workers
- 1216fc9: Export regular functions from dialog.ts, pass tests (followup from https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/124)
- 6fc4c50: Display error message when unknown command is provided to the wrangler CLI.
- 23543fe: Allow the developer to exit `init` if there is already a toml file
- 1df6b0c: enable @typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises, pass lint+type check
- 3c5725f: CI/CD Cleanup
  - Removed the build step from tests, which should speed up the "Tests" Workflow.
  - Added a branch specific trigger for "Release", now the Workflow for "Release" should only work on PRs closed to `main`
  - Removed the "Changeset PR" Workflow. Now the "Release" Workflow will handle everything needed for Changesets.
- fb0eae7: support importing `.wasm` files / `workers-rs` support
- e928f94: Improve support for package exports conditionals, including "worker" condition
- 43e7a82: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.4`
- f473942: Replaces the static asset server with a more faithful simulation of what happens with a production Pages project.

  Also improves error handling and automatically opens the browser when running `wrangler pages dev`.

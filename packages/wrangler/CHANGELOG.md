# wrangler

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2538](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/2538) [`af4f27c5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/af4f27c5966f52e605ab7c16ff9746b7802d3479) Thanks [@edevil](https://github.com/edevil)! - feat: support EmailEvent event type in `wrangler tail`.

* [#2404](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/2404) [`3f824347`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/3f824347c624a2cedf4af2b6bbd781b8581b08b5) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - feat: support bundling the raw Pages `_worker.js` before deploying

  Previously, if you provided a `_worker.js` file, then Pages would simply check the
  file for disallowed imports and then deploy the file as-is.

  Not bundling the `_worker.js` file means that it cannot containing imports to other
  JS files, but also prevents Wrangler from adding shims such as the one for the D1 alpha
  release.

  This change adds the ability to tell Wrangler to pass the `_worker.js` through the
  normal Wrangler bundling process before deploying by setting the `--bundle`
  command line argument to `wrangler pages dev` and `wrangler pages publish`.

  This is in keeping with the same flag for `wrangler publish`.

  Currently bundling is opt-in, flag defaults to `false` if not provided.

  `_routes.json` is no longer considered an experimental feature, so let's
  remove all warnings we have in place for that.

  A subtle difference when removing object-spreading of experimental unstable_dev() options caused `wrangler pages dev` interactivity to stop working. This switches back to object-spreading the passed in options on top of the defaults, fixing the issue.

  When using `wrangler init`, and choosing to create a Typescript project, you will now be asked if Wrangler should write tests for you, using Vitest.

  This resolves issue #2436.

  When applying D1 migrations to a deployed database, it is important that we are logged in
  and that we have the database ID from the wrangler.toml.
  This is not needed for `--local` mode where we are just writing to a local SQLite file.

  If you are developing Wrangler, or an internal Cloudflare feature, and during testing,
  need Wrangler to target the staging API rather than production, it is now possible by
  setting the `WRANGLER_API_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `staging`.

  This will update all the necessary OAuth and API URLs, update the OAuth client ID, and
  also (if necessary) acquire an Access token for to get through the firewall to the
  staging URLs.

  This fix updates the SQL statement splitting so that it does not split in the middle of compound statements.
  Previously we were using a third party splitting library, but this needed fixing and was actually unnecessary for our purposes.
  So a new splitter has been implemented and the library dependency removed.
  Also the error handling in `d1 migrations apply` has been improved to handle a wider range of error types.

  Publishing Pages projects containing a functions directory incorrectly did not upload the filepath-routing config so that the user can view it in Dash. This fixes that, making the generated routes viewable under `Routing configuration` in the `Functions` tab of a deployment.

* [#2130](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/2130) [`68f4fa6f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/68f4fa6ff7d537c602c3b2ba99e9ce3afdbf2242) Thanks [@matthewdavidrodgers](https://github.com/matthewdavidrodgers)! - feature: Add warnings around bundle sizes for large scripts

  Prints a warning for scripts > 1MB compressed, encouraging smaller
  script sizes. This warning can be silenced by setting the
  NO_SCRIPT_SIZE_WARNING env variable

  If a publish fails with either a script size error or a validator error
  on script startup (CPU or memory), we print out the largest 5
  dependencies in your bundle. This is accomplished by using the esbuild
  generated metafile.

If you don't have `cloudflared` installed, Wrangler will prompt you to install it. If you _do_, then the first time you start developing using `wrangler dev` your default browser will open with a Cloudflare Access prompt.

  Added the `--from-dash` name as a fallback when no name is provided in the `wrangler init` command.
  Additionally added a checks to the `std.out` to ensure that the name is provided.

  resolves #1853

- [#2073](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/2073) [`1987a79d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/1987a79d43158ebc6eeb54b2102214060266b6d7) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - If `--env <env>` is specified, we'll now check `.env.<env>`/`.dev.vars.<env>` first.
  If they don't exist, we'll fallback to `.env`/`.dev.vars`.

  Now the `vars` will be computed, example:
  `[var.binding.name]: var.binding.text`

  this will resolve the issue that was occurring with
  generating a TOML with incorrect fields for the `vars` key/value pair.

  resolves #2048

## 2.1.15

### Patch Changes

- [#2103](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/2103) [`f1fd62a1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/f1fd62a11642de45eb87ebacb044fe8fcf2beea2) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - fix: Don't upload `functions/` directory as part of `wrangler pages publish`

  If the root directory of a project was the same as the build output directory, we were previously uploading the `functions/` directory as static assets. This PR now ensures that the `functions/` files are only used to create Pages Functions and are no longer uploaded as static assets.

  Additionally, we also now _do_ upload `_worker.js`, `_headers`, `_redirects` and `_routes.json` if they aren't immediate children of the build output directory. Previously, we'd ignore all files with this name regardless of location. For example, if you have a `public/blog/how-to-use-pages/_headers` file (where `public` is your build output directory), we will now upload the `_headers` file as a static asset.

* [#2111](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/2111) [`ab52f771`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/ab52f7717ffd5411886d1e30aee98f821237ddad) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - feat: Add a `passThroughOnException()` handler in Pages Functions

  This `passThroughOnException()` handler is not as good as the built-in for Workers. We're just adding it now as a stop-gap until we can do the behind-the-scenes plumbing required to make the built-in function work properly.

  We wrap your Pages Functions code in a `try/catch` and on failure, if you call `passThroughOnException()` we defer to the static assets of your project.

  For example:

  ```ts
  export const onRequest = ({ passThroughOnException }) => {
  	passThroughOnException();

  	x; // Would ordinarily throw an error, but instead, static assets are served.
  };
  ```

  Custom module rules generate `declare module`s based on the module type (`Text`, `Data` or `CompiledWasm`).
  Module Example Outputs:

  **CompiledWasm**

  ```ts
  declare module "**/*.wasm" {
  	const value: WebAssembly.Module;
  	export default value;

  Currently, the logic by which we transform routing rules in `_routes.json` to
  regular expressions, so we can perform `pathname` matching & routing when we
  run `wrangler pages dev`, is too permissive, and leads to serving incorrect
  assets for certain url paths.

  For example, a routing rule such as `/foo` will incorrectly match pathname
  `/bar/foo`. Similarly, pathname `/foo` will be incorrectly matched by the
  `/` routing rule.
  This commit fixes our routing rule to pathname matching logic and brings
  `wrangler pages dev` on par with routing in deployed Pages projects.

  This patch deletes any site/asset kv namespaces associated with a worker when `wrangler delete` is used. It finds the namespace associated with a worker by using the names it would have otherwise used, and deletes it. It also does the same for the preview namespace that's used with `wrangler dev`.

  Previously, when trying to publish a worker to a route that was in use by another worker,
  there would be a really unhelpful message about a failed API call. Now, there's a much
  nicer message that tells you what worker is running on that route, and gives you a link
  to the workers overview page so you can unassign it if you want.

  Previously, when a user wanted to publish a worker to https://workers.dev by setting `workers_dev = true` in their `wrangler.toml`,
  but their account didn't have a subdomain registered, we would error out.

  Now, we offer to create one for them. It's not implemented for `wrangler dev`, which also expects you to have registered a
  workers.dev subdomain, but we now error correctly and tell them what the problem is.

  Wrangler depends on terminals supporting [raw mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_mode). Previously, attempting to run wrangler from a terminal that didn't support raw mode would result in
  an Ink error, which was both an exposure of an internal implementation detail to the user and also not actionable:

  ```text
    ERROR Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin, which Ink uses
         as input stream by default.
         Read about how to prevent this error on
         https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/#israwmodesupported
  ```

  Now, we provide a much nicer error, which provides an easy next step for th user:

  ```text

  ERROR: This terminal doesn't support raw mode.

  Wrangler uses raw mode to read user input and write output to the terminal, and won't function correctly without it.

  Try running your previous command in a terminal that supports raw mode, such as Command Prompt or Powershell.

- [#1957](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1957) [`b579c2b5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/b579c2b5ad8dc1d19e1b4bf7ff11f56d0c8d4e1f) Thanks [@caass](https://github.com/caass)! - Remove dependency on create-cloudflare.

  Previously, `wrangler generate` was a thin wrapper around [`create-cloudflare`](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare). Now, we've moved over the logic from that package directly into `wrangler`.

* [#1985](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1985) [`51385e57`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/51385e5740c189ec4854c76307cb9ed821e3712f) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: hide deprecated flags from --help menu

- [#1944](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1944) [`ea54623c`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/ea54623ce2f2f5bc5ac5c48a58730bb3f75afd9c) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - `wrangler pages publish` should prioritize `_worker.js` over `/functions` if both exist

* [#1950](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1950) [`daf73fbe`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/daf73fbe03b55631383cdc86a05eac12d2775875) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - `wrangler pages dev` should prioritize `_worker.js`

  When using a `_worker.js` file, the entire `/functions` directory should be ignored – this includes its routing and middleware characteristics. Currently `wrangler pages dev` does the reverse, by prioritizing
  `/functions` over `_worker.js`. These changes fix the current behaviour.

- [#1928](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1928) [`c1722170`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/c1722170e93101a292a3c14110b131457f7164d6) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - fix: Allow unsetting of automatically generated `Link` headers using `_headers` and the `! Link` operator

* [#1928](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1928) [`c1722170`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/c1722170e93101a292a3c14110b131457f7164d6) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - fix: Only generate `Link` headers from simple `<link>` elements.

  Specifically, only those with the `rel`, `href` and possibly `as` attributes. Any element with additional attributes will not be used to generate headers.

- [#1974](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1974) [`a96f2585`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/a96f25856615befef5d03adffd3808a393bf145e) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - chore: Bump @cloudflare/pages-shared@0.0.7 and use TS directly

* [#1965](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1965) [`9709d3a3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/9709d3a31d4fc192c257d0347f111dec465fd20c) Thanks [@JacobMGEvans](https://github.com/JacobMGEvans)! - chore: remove hidden on --from-dash
  The --from-dash can now be used with the dashboard features to support moving Worker developmment to a local machine.

  resolves #1783

- [#1978](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1978) [`6006ae50`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/6006ae5010ab32bbd81b002b26cd450cdf58b1a5) Thanks [@JacobMGEvans](https://github.com/JacobMGEvans)! - chore: Undici 5.11.0 multipart/form-data support
  The 5.11.0 version of Undici now supports multipart/form-data previously needed a ponyfill
  we can now handle the multipart/form-data without any custom code.

  resolves #1977

## 2.1.10

### Patch Changes

- [#1955](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1955) [`b6dd07a1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/b6dd07a1ba823c45244de18c2ebbe1e3b56c1ed7) Thanks [@cameron-robey](https://github.com/cameron-robey)! - chore: error if d1 bindings used with `no-bundle`

  While in beta, you cannot use D1 bindings without bundling your worker as these are added in through a facade which gets bypassed when using the `no-bundle` option.

* [#1964](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1964) [`1f50578e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/1f50578ee8f8a007464b7bd4061a5df74488dbc0) Thanks [@JacobMGEvans](https://github.com/JacobMGEvans)! - chore: Emoji space in help description
  Added a space between the Emoji and description for the secret:bulk command.

- [#1967](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1967) [`02261f27`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/02261f27d9d3a6b83087d12b8e653d0039176a83) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - feat: implement remote mode for unstable_dev

  With this change, `unstable_dev` can now perform end-to-end (e2e) tests against your workers as you dev.

  Note that to use this feature in CI, you'll need to configure `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` as an environment variable in your CI, and potentially add `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` as an environment variable in your CI, or `account_id` in your `wrangler.toml`.

  Usage:

  ```js
  await unstable_dev("src/index.ts", {
  	local: false
  });
  ```

## 2.1.9

### Patch Changes

- [#1937](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1937) [`905fce4f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/905fce4feb0ac34200b597ff5e8c325aaf65b491) Thanks [@JacobMGEvans](https://github.com/JacobMGEvans)! - fix: fails to publish due to empty migrations
  After this change, `wrangler init --from-dash` will not attempt to add durable object migrations to `wrangler.toml` for Workers that don't have durable objects.

  fixes #1854

* [#1943](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1943) [`58a430f2`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/58a430f27fb683f422e552f7c26338f950f39c2b) Thanks [@cameron-robey](https://github.com/cameron-robey)! - chore: add `env` and `ctx` params to `fetch` in javascript example template

  Just like in the typescript templates, and the javascript template for scheduled workers, we include `env` and `ctx` as parameters to the `fetch` export. This makes it clearer where environment variables live.

- [#1934](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1934) [`7ebaec1a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/7ebaec1a38384b5f04001ad2d8603d7ac0322534) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - Allow `--experimental-local` to be used with module workers

* [#1939](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1939) [`5854cb69`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/5854cb6918cd0271683b4f3f62987f3e9e4b3300) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: respect variable binding type when printing

  After this change, when printing the bindings it has access to, wrangler will correctly only add quotes around string variables, and serialize objects via JSON.stringify (rather than printing `"[object Object]"`).

- [#1953](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1953) [`20195479`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/20195479c9f57d9fede1f5924f6a4ab36f860bea) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - Add `--experimental-local` support to `unstable_dev`

* [#1930](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1930) [`56798155`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/5679815521d7e62d24866eee1653ba409a53e12b) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: use node http instead of faye-websocket in proxy server

  We change how websockets are handled in the proxy server, fixing multiple issues of websocket behaviour, particularly to do with headers.

  In particular this fixes:

  - the protocol passed between the client and the worker was being stripped out by wrangler
  - wrangler was discarding additional headesr from websocket upgrade response
  - websocket close code and reason was not being propagated by wrangler

## 2.1.8

### Patch Changes

- [#1894](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1894) [`ed646cf9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/ed646cf902a86f467ec2ed08545ced3f97468d31) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - Add experimental support for using the open-source Workers runtime [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) in `wrangler dev`.
  Use `wrangler dev --experimental-local` to try it out! 🚀
  Note this feature is still under active development.

## 2.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [#1881](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1881) [`6ff5a030`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/6ff5a0308b8f65f0422719ede3a2a4863311d3d9) Thanks [@Skye-31](https://github.com/Skye-31)! - Chore: correctly log all listening ports on remote mode (closes #1652)

* [#1913](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1913) [`9f7cc5a0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/9f7cc5a06a704ff2320d0a1996baf6a1da7845a4) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: expose port and address on (Unstable)DevWorker

  when using `unstable_dev()`, I think we want to expose the port/address that the server has started on. The usecase is when trying to connect to the server _without_ calling `.fetch()` (example: when making a websocket connection).

- [#1911](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1911) [`16c28502`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/16c28502593c27a1b372d8056a55cdee32b5c4cf) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: put config cache log behind logger.debug

  Prior to this change, wrangler would print `Retrieving cached values for...` after almost every single command.

  After this change, you'll only see this message if you add `WRANGLER_LOG=debug` before your command.

  Closes #1808

* [#1687](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1687) [`28cd7361`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/28cd7361a6386913b62389705c335dd1b12d1dd6) Thanks [@geelen](https://github.com/geelen)! - Wrangler now supports the beta release of D1.

## 2.1.6

### Patch Changes

- [#1890](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1890) [`5a4c7113`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/5a4c7113bd34753f571d7c7984658c8b3bb033e0) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: add missing noBundle type to api/dev

* [#1895](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1895) [`1b53bf9d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/1b53bf9d06fbe2afbd43c18b6406e59e85618dc3) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: rename keep_bindings to keep_vars, and make it opt-in, to keep wrangler.toml compatible with being used for Infrastructure as Code

  By default, wrangler.toml is the source of truth for your environment configuration, like a terraform file.

  If you change your settings (particularly your vars) in the dashboard, wrangler _will_ override them. If you want to disable this behavior, set this field to true.

  Between wrangler 2.0.28 and 2.1.5, by default wrangler would _not_ delete your vars by default, breaking expected wrangler.toml behaviour.

- [#1889](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1889) [`98f756c7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/98f756c7dfcdefaf1426b6770d0c0450ce4a8619) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - fix: Correctly place the `.wrangler/state` local state directory in the same directory as `wrangler.toml` by default

  Fixed a bug where compatibility_date wasn't being added to wrangler.toml when initializing a worker via `wrangler init --from-dash`

  fixes #1855

## 2.1.5

### Patch Changes

- [#1819](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1819) [`d8a18070`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/d8a18070c5abe5d9e62da4d5adab794626156ab3) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - Adds support for custom \_routes.json when running `wrangler pages dev`

  Using the new middleware (https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1735), we implement a way of testing scheduled workers from a fetch using `wrangler dev` in remote mode, by passing a new command line flag `--test-scheduled`. This exposes a route `/__scheduled` which will trigger the scheduled event.

  ```sh
  $ npx wrangler dev index.js --test-scheduled

  $ curl http://localhost:8787/__scheduled
  ```

  Closes https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/570

- [#1801](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1801) [`07fc90d6`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/07fc90d60912d6906a4b419db8cefc501e693473) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - feat: multi-worker testing

  This change introduces the ability to test multi-worker setups via the wrangler API's [unstable_dev](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_dev) function.

  Usage:

  ```js
  import { unstable_dev } from "wrangler";

  /**
   * Note: if you shut down the first worker you spun up,
   * the parent worker won't know the child worker exists
   * and your tests will fail
   */
  describe("multi-worker testing", () => {
  	let childWorker;
  	let parentWorker;

  	beforeAll(async () => {
  		childWorker = await unstable_dev(
  			"src/child-worker.js",
  			{ config: "src/child-wrangler.toml" },
  			{ disableExperimentalWarning: true }
  		);
  		parentWorker = await unstable_dev(
  			"src/parent-worker.js",
  			{ config: "src/parent-wrangler.toml" },
  			{ disableExperimentalWarning: true }
  		);
  	});

  	afterAll(async () => {
  		await childWorker.stop();
  		await parentWorker.stop();
  	});

  	it("childWorker should return Hello World itself", async () => {
  		const resp = await childWorker.fetch();
  		if (resp) {
  			const text = await resp.text();
  			expect(text).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`"Hello World!"`);
  		}
  	});

  	it("parentWorker should return Hello World by invoking the child worker", async () => {
  		const resp = await parentWorker.fetch();
  		if (resp) {
  			const parsedResp = await resp.text();
  			expect(parsedResp).toEqual("Parent worker sees: Hello World!");
  		}
  	});
  });
  ```

  Added a '--log-level' flag that allows the user to specify between 'debug', 'info', 'log', 'warning', 'error', 'none'
  Currently 'none' will turn off all outputs in Miniflare (local mode), however, Wrangler will still output Errors.

  Added --persist and --persist-to in its place. Changed the default persistence directory to .wrangler/state, relative to wrangler.toml.

  To migrate to the new flag, run `mkdir -p .wrangler && mv wrangler-local-state .wrangler/state` then use `--persist`. Alternatively, you can use `--persist-to=./wrangler-local-state` to keep using the files in the old location.

  Prior to this change, wrangler would check to see if a port was available, do a bit more work, then try use that port when starting miniflare. With this change, we're using port 0 to tell Node to assign us a random free port.

  To make this change work, we had to do some plumbing so miniflare can tell us the host and port it's using, so we can call fetch against it.

  Makes `wrangler init`'s `--from-dash` option pull in data from Cloudflare's dashboard to generate a wrangler.toml file populated with configuration from an existing Worker.
  This is a first step towards making `wrangler init` more useful for folks who are already using Cloudflare's products on the Dashboard.

* [#1762](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1762) [`23f89216`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/23f8921628baf32f0cace1ebf893964a26afe91a) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - Use getBasePath() when trying to specify paths to files relative to the
  base of the Wrangler package directory rather than trying to compute the
  path from Node.js constants like **dirname and **filename. This is
  because the act of bundling the source code can move the file that contains
  these constants around potentially breaking the relative path to the desired files.

  Fixes #1755

- [#1763](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1763) [`75f3ae82`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/75f3ae829b0b4f8ae2cf2093bda93e8096838240) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - Add `description` field to \_routes.json

  When generating routes for Functions projects, let's add a description

* [#1538](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1538) [`2c9caf74`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/2c9caf74bdf3f60db7c244b2202f358abe5ced1f) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - chore: refactor wrangler.dev API to not need React/Ink

  Prior to this change, `wrangler.unstable_dev()` would only support running one instance of wrangler at a time, as Ink only lets you render one instance of React. This resulted in test failures in CI.

  This change creates pure JS/TS versions of these React hooks:

  - useEsbuild
  - useLocalWorker
  - useCustomBuild
  - useTmpDir

  As a side-effect of removing React, tests should run faster in CI.

### Patch Changes

- [#1725](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1725) [`eb75413e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/eb75413ec35f6d4f6306601f4d5c9d058f794a18) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - rename: `worker_namespaces` / `dispatch_namespaces`

  The Worker-for-Platforms team would like to rename this field to more closely match what it's called internally. This fix does a search+replace on this term. This feature already had an experimental warning, and no one's using it at the moment, so we're not going to add a warning/backward compat for existing customers.

* [#1736](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1736) [`800f8553`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/800f8553b25bb0641fd5e9b38eb5d9ca02abe24c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: do not delete previously defined plain_text/json bindings on publish

  Currently, when we publish a worker, we delete an pre-existing bindings if they're not otherwise defined in `wrangler.toml`, and overwrite existing ones. But folks may be deploying with wrangler, and changing environment variables on the fly (like marketing messages, etc). It's annoying when deploying via wrangler blows away those values.

  This patch fixes one of those issues. It will not delete any older bindings that are not in wrangler.toml. It still _does_ overwrite existing vars, but at least this gives a way for developers to have some vars that are not blown away on every publish.

- [#1726](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1726) [`0b83504c`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/0b83504c12b35301acaeb5302c0d16021c958f8e) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - fix: Multiworker and static asset dev bug preventing both from being used

  There was previously a collision on the generated filenames which resulted in the generated scripts looping and crashing in Miniflare with error code 7. By renaming one of the generated files, this is avoided.

* [#1718](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1718) [`02f1fe9b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/02f1fe9b07bb08b7395e7de1d78cc929221b464f) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: use `config.dev.ip` when provided

  Because we'd used a default for 0.0.0.0 for the `--ip` flag, `wrangler dev` was overriding the value specified in `wrangler.toml` under `dev.ip`. This fix removes the default value (since it's being set when normalising config anyway).

  Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1714

- [#1727](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1727) [`3f9e8f63`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/3f9e8f634e6544bf3aef8748f56041a077758ab2) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: refresh token when we detect that the preview session has expired (error code 10049)

  When running `wrangler dev`, from time to time the preview session token would expire, and the dev server would need to be manually restarted. This fixes this, by refreshing the token when it expires.

  Closes #1446

* [#1730](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1730) [`27ad80ee`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/27ad80eed7f25393a0e5c1d8a62c3b0e743a639d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: `--var name:value` and `--define name:value`

  This enables passing values for `[vars]` and `[define]` via the cli. We have a number of usecases where the values to be injected during dev/publish aren't available statically (eg: a version string, some identifier for 3p libraries, etc) and reading those values only from `wrangler.toml` isn't good ergonomically. So we can now read those values when passed through the CLI.

  Example: add a var during dev: `wrangler dev --var xyz:123` will inject the var `xyz` with string `"123"`

  (note, only strings allowed for `--var`)

  substitute a global value: `wrangler dev --define XYZ:123` will replace every global identifier `XYZ` with the value `123`.

  The same flags also work with `wrangler publish`.

  Also, you can use actual environment vars in these commands. e.g.: `wrangler dev --var xyz:$XYZ` will set `xyz` to whatever `XYZ` has been set to in the terminal environment.

- [#1700](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1700) [`d7c23e49`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/d7c23e49706cb8fdb6eb71ece9fb4eca14c62df8) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - Closes [#1505](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1505) by extending `wrangler tail` to allow for passing worker routes as well as worker script names.

  For example, if you have a worker `example-worker` assigned to the route `example.com/*`, you can retrieve it's logs by running either `wrangler tail example.com/*` or `wrangler tail example-worker`—previously only `wrangler tail example-worker` was supported.

  Currently, if the process pages dev is proxying exists or crashes, pages dev does not clean it up, and attempts to continue proxying requests to it, resulting in it throwing 502 errors. This fixes that behaviour to make wrangler exit with the code the child_process exits with.

  Building on [the recent work for multi-worker Service bindings in local dev](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1503), this now adds support for direct Durable Object namespace bindings.

  A parent (calling) Worker will look for child Workers (where the Durable Object has been defined) by matching the `script_name` configuration option with the child's Service name. For example, if you have a Worker A which defines a Durable Object, `MyDurableObject`, and Worker B which references A's Durable Object:

  ```toml
  name = "A"

  [durable_objects]
  bindings = [
  	{ name = "MY_DO", class_name = "MyDurableObject" }
  ]
  ```

  ```toml
  name = "B"

  [durable_objects]
  bindings = [
  	{ name = "REFERENCED_DO", class_name = "MyDurableObject", script_name = "A" }
  ]
  ```

  `MY_DO` will work as normal in Worker A. `REFERENCED_DO` in Worker B will point at A's Durable Object.

  Note: this only works in local mode (`wrangler dev --local`) at present.

We cannot access the permissions on an API key, so we direct the user to the location in the dashboard to achieve this.

  Preamble: Typically, a Worker has been the _unit_ of a javascript project on our platform. Any logic that you need, you fit into one worker, ~ 1MB of javascript and bindings. If you wanted to deploy a larger application, you could define different workers on different routes. This is fine for microservice style architectures, but not all projects can be cleaved along the route boundaries; you lose out on sharing code and resources, and can still cross the size limit with heavy dependencies.

  Service bindings provide a novel mechanism for composing multiple workers into a unified architecture. You could deploy shared code into a worker, and make requests to it from another worker. This lets you architect your code along functional boundaries, while also providing some relief to the 1MB size limit.

  I propose a model for developing multiple bound workers in a single project.

  Consider Worker A, at `workers/a.js`, with a `wrangler.toml` like so:

  ```toml
  name = 'A'

  [[services]]
  binding = 'Bee'
  service = 'B'
  ```

  and content like so:

  ```js
  export default {
  	fetch(req, env) {
  		return env.Bee.fetch(req);
  	}
  };
  ```

  Consider Worker B, at `workers/b.js`, with a `wrangler.toml` like so:

  ```toml
  name = 'B'
  ```

  and content like so:

  ```js
  export default {
  	fetch(req, env) {
  		return new Response("Hello World");
  	}
  };
  ```

  So, a worker A, bound to B, that simply passes on the request to B.

  ## Local mode:

  Currently, when I run `wrangler dev --local` on A (or switch from remote to local mode during a dev session), and make requests to A, they'll fail because the bindings don't exist in local mode.

  What I'd like, is to be able to run `wrangler dev --local` on B as well, and have my dev instance of A make requests to the dev instance of B. When I'm happy with my changes, I'd simply deploy both workers (again, ideally as a batched publish).

  ## Proposal: A local dev registry for workers.

  - Running `wrangler dev` on a machine should start up a local service registry (if there isn't one loaded already) as a server on a well known port.
  - Further, it should then "register" itself with the registry with metadata about itself; whether it's running in remote/local mode, the port and ip its dev server is listening on, and any additional configuration (eg: in remote mode, a couple of extra headers have to be added to every request made to the dev session, so we'd add that data into the registry as well.)
  - Every worker that has service bindings configured, should intercept requests to said binding, and instead make a request to the locally running instance of the service. It could rewrite these requests as it pleases.

  (In future PRs, we'll introduce a system for doing the same with remote mode dev, as well as mixed mode. )

  This adds an internal mechanism for applying multiple "middleware"/facades on to workers. This lets us add functionality during dev and/or publish, where we can modify requests or env, or other ideas. (See https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1466 for actual usecases)

  As part of this, I implemented a simple facade that formats errors in dev. To enable it you need to set an environment variable `FORMAT_WRANGLER_ERRORS=true`. This _isn't_ a new feature we're shipping with wrangler, it's simply to demonstrate how to write middleware. We'll probably remove it in the future.

  Couple things cleaned up here:

  Originally the usage of the /domains api (for publishing to custom domains) was a bit clumsy: we would attempt to optimistically publish, but the api would eagerly fail with specific error codes on why it occurred. This made for some weird control flow for retries with override flags, as well as fragile extraction of error messages.

  Now we use the new /domains/changeset api to generate a changeset of actions required to get to a new state of custom domains, which informs us up front of which domains would need to be updated and overridden, and we can pass flags as needed. I do make an extra hop back to the api to lookup what the custom domains requiring updates are already attached to, but given how helpful I imagine that to be, I'm for it.

  I also updated the api used for publishing the domains, from /domains to /domains/records. The latter was added to allow us to add flexibility for things like the /domains/changeset resource, and thus the former is being deprecated

  When running version command, we want to display update information if current version is not up to date. Achieved by replacing default output with the wrangler banner.
  Previous behaviour (just outputting current version) reamins when !isTTY.
  Version command changed from inbuilt .version() from yargs, to a regular command to allow for asynchronous behaviour.

  - adds features that `pages dev` was missing (e.g. `--local-protocol`),
  - and reduces the maintenance burden of `wrangler pages dev` going forward.

  In dev, we inject a patch for `fetch()` to detect bad usages. This patch is copied into the destination directory before it's used. esbuild appears to have a bug where it thinks a dependency has changed so it restarts once in local mode. The fix here is to copy the file to inject into a separate temporary dir.

  When using an api token, sometimes the call to get a user's membership details fails with a 9109 error.

  We replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in workers with the value of the environment variable. However, we have a bug where when we make an actual build of wrangler (which has NODE_ENV set as "production"), we were also replacing the expression where we'd replace it in a worker. The result was that all workers would have `process.env.NODE_ENV` set to production, no matter what the user had set. The fix here is to use a "dynamic" value for the expression so that our build system doesn't replace it.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/992, we added a dev-only helper that would warn when using `fetch()` in a manner that wouldn't work as expected (because of a bug we currently have in the runtime). We did this by injecting a file that would override usages of `fetch()`. When using pnp style package managers like yarn, this file can't be resolved correctly. So to fix that, we extract it into the temporary destination directory that we use to build the worker (much like a similar fix we did in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1154)

  The new metrics usage capture may interact with the user if they have not yet set their metrics permission.

  This change adds support in Wrangler for sending usage metrics to Cloudflare.
  This is an opt-in only feature. We will ask the user for permission only once per device.
  The user must grant permission, on a per device basis, before we send usage metrics to Cloudflare.
  The permission can also be overridden on a per project basis by setting `send_metrics = false` in the `wrangler.toml`.
  If Wrangler is running in non-interactive mode (such as in a CI job) and the user has not already given permission
  we will assume that we cannot send usage metrics.

  The aim of this feature is to help us learn what and how features of Wrangler (and also the Cloudflare dashboard)
  are being used in order to improve the developer experience.

  In Workers published to the Edge (rather than previews) there is a bug where a custom port on a downstream fetch request is ignored, defaulting to the standard port.
  For example, `https://my.example.com:668` will actually send the request to `https://my.example.com:443`.

  Prior to this PR, users of `unstable_dev` had to provide their own fetcher, and guess the address and port that the wrangler dev server was using.

  With this implementation, it's now possible to test wrangler, using just wrangler (and a test framework):

  ```js
  describe("worker", async () => {
    const worker = await wrangler.unstable_dev("src/index.ts");

    const resp = await worker.fetch();

    expect(resp).not.toBe(undefined);

  This fix renames the `--no-build` cli arg to `--no-bundle`. `no-build` wasn't a great name because it would imply that we don't run custom builds specified under `[build]` which isn't true. So we rename closer to what wrangler actually does, which is bundling the input. This also makes it clearer that it's a single file upload.

  This adds caching for account id fetch/selection for all wrangler commands.

  Currently, if we have an api/oauth token, but haven't provided an account id, we fetch account information from cloudflare. If a user has just one account id, we automatically choose that. If there are more than one, then we show a dropdown and ask the user to pick one. This is convenient, and lets the user not have to specify their account id when starting a project.

  However, if does make startup slow, since it has to do that fetch every time. It's also annoying for folks with multiple account ids because they have to pick their account id every time.

  So we now cache the account details into `node_modules/.cache/wrangler` (much like pages already does with account id and project name).

  This patch also refactors `config-cache.ts`; it only caches if there's a `node_modules` folder, and it looks for the closest node_modules folder (and not directly in cwd). I also added tests for when a `node_modules` folder isn't available. It also trims the message that we log to terminal.

  Previously, we would be creating a fresh session for every script change during remote dev. While this _worked_, it makes iterating slower, and unnecessarily discards state. This fix makes it so we create only a single session for remote dev, and reuses that session on every script change. This also means we can use a single script id for every worker in a session (when a name isn't already given). Further, we also make the prewarming call of the preview space be non-blocking.

  In older templates, (i.e made for wrangler 1.x), `account_id =''` is considered as a valid input, but then ignored. With wrangler 2, when running wrangler dev, we log an error, but it fixes itself after we get an account id. Much like https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1329, the fix here is to normalise that value when we see it, and replace it with `undefined` while logging a warning.

  This fix also tweaks the messaging for a blank route value to suggest some user action.

  The maximum _request_ size for a batch upload is 100 MB. We were previously calculating the upload key value to be under _100 MiB_. Further, with a few bytes here and there, the size of the request can exceed 100 MiB. So this fix calculate using MB instead of MiB, but also brings down our own limit to 98 MB so there's some wiggle room for uploads.

  This implements `config.define`. This lets the user define a map of keys to strings that will be substituted in the worker's source. This is particularly useful when combined with environments. A common usecase is for values that are sent along with metrics events; environment name, public keys, version numbers, etc. It's also sometimes a workaround for the usability of module env vars, which otherwise have to be threaded through request function stacks.

  As raised in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1254, it was discovered that binary uploads were being mangled by wrangler 2, whereas they worked in wrangler 1. This is because they were read into a string by providing an explicit encoding of `utf-8`. This fix reads provided files into a node `Buffer` that is then passed directly to the request.

  Subsequently https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1273 was raised in relation to a similar issue with gets from wrangler 2. This was happening due to the downloaded file being converted to `utf-8` encoding as it was pushed through `console.log`. By leveraging `process.stdout.write` we can push the fetched `ArrayBuffer` to std out directly without inferring any specific encoding value.

  If `git` does not support the `--initial-branch` argument then just fallback to the default initial branch name.

  We tried to be more clever about this but there are two many weird corner cases with different git versions on different architectures.
  Now we do our best, with recent versions of git, to ensure that the branch is called `main` but otherwise just make sure we don't crash.

  When initializing a new project (via `wrangler init`) we attempt to reuse files in the current

  As raised in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1254, it was discovered that binary uploads were being mangled by wrangler 2, whereas they worked in wrangler 1. This is because they were read into a string by providing an explicit encoding of `utf-8`. This fix reads provided files into a node `Buffer` that is then passed directly to the request.

  When we upload a script bundle, we get the actual content of the script back in the response. Sometimes that script can be large (depending on whether the upload was large), and currently it may even be a badly escaped string. We can pass a queryparam `excludeScript` that, as it implies, exclude the script content in the response. This fix does that.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/1241, we removed the vendored version of `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`, as well as the build configuration that would point to the vendored version when compiling a worker using `--experimental-public`. However, wrangler can be used where it's not installed in the `package.json` for the worker, or even when there's no package.json at all (like when wrangler is installed globally, or used with `npx`). In this situation, if the user doesn't have `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` installed, then building the worker will fail. We don't want to make the user install this themselves, so instead we point to a barrel import for the library in the facade for the worker.

  In projects where:

  - all the source code isn't in one folder (like a monorepo, or even where the worker has non-standard imports across folders),
  - we use a custom build, so it's hard to statically determine folders to watch for changes

  ...we'd like to be able to specify multiple paths for custom builds, (the config `build.watch_dir` config). This patch enables such behaviour. It now accepts a single path as before, or optionally an array of strings/paths.

  We'd previously vendored in `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` and `mime` for `--experimental-public`. We've since updated `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` to support module workers correctly, and don't need the vendored versions anymore. This patch uses the lib as a dependency, and deletes the `vendor` folder.

  As reported in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1189, we're including the name of the folder in the keys of the KV store that stores the assets. This doesn't match v1 behaviour. It makes sense not to include these since, we should be able to move around the folder and not have to reupload the entire folder again.

  When generating a preview session on the edge with `wrangler dev`, for a zoned worker we were using a random id as the script ID. This would make the backend not associate the dev session with any resources that were otherwise assigned to the script (specifically for secrets, but other stuff as well) The fix is simply to use the worker name (when available) as the script ID.

  Previously, if you are not logged in when running `wrangler dev` it will only try to log you in
  if you start in "remote" mode. In "local" mode there is no need to be logged in, so it doesn't
  bother to try to login, and then will crash if you switch to "remote" mode interactively.

  The problem was that we were only attempting to login once before creating the `<Remote>` component.
  Now this logic has been moved into a `useEffect()` inside `<Remote>` so that it will be run whether
  starting in "remote" or transitioning to "remote" from "local".

  The fact that the check is no longer done before creating the components is proven by removing the
  `mockAccountId()` and `mockApiToken()` calls from the `dev.test.ts` files.

  While we wait for changes to the CF API to support API tokens that do not have
  "All Zone" permissions, this change provides a workaround for most scenarios.

  If the bulk-route request fails with an authorization error, then we fallback
  to the Wrangler 1 approach, which sends individual route updates via a zone-based
  endpoint.

  When `wrangler init` is used to create a new Scheduled Worker a cron trigger (1 \* \* \* \*) will be added to wrangler.toml, but only if wrangler.toml is being created during init. If wrangler.toml exists prior to running `wrangler init` then wrangler.toml will remain unchanged even if the user selects the "Scheduled Handler" option. This is as per existing tests in init.test.ts that ensure wrangler.toml is never overwritten after agreeing to prompts. That can change if it needs to.

  Because we were calling `printBindings` during the render phase of `<Dev/>`, we were logging the bindings multiple times (render can be called multiple times, and the interaction of Ink's stdout output intermingled with console is a bit weird). We could have put it into an effect, but I think a better solution here is to simply log it before we even start rendering `<Dev/>` (so we could see the bindings even if Dev fails to load, for example).

  This also adds a fix that masks any overriden values so that we don't accidentally log potential secrets into the terminal.

  With package managers like yarn, the cloudflare cert won't be available on the filesystem as expected (since the module is inside a .zip file).

This adds experimental support for service bindings, aka worker-to-worker bindings. It's lets you "call" a worker from another worker, without incurring any network cost, and (ideally) with much less latency. To use it, define a `[services]` field in `wrangler.toml`, which is a map of bindings to worker names (and environment). Let's say you already have a worker named "my-worker" deployed. In another worker's configuration, you can create a service binding to it like so:

```toml
[[services]]
binding = "MYWORKER"
service = "my-worker"
environment = "production" # optional, defaults to the worker's `default_environment` for now
````

And in your worker, you can call it like so:

```js
export default {
	fetch(req, env, ctx) {
		return env.MYWORKER.fetch(new Request("http://domain/some-path"));
	}
};

  We check for the presence of Git by trying to run `git --version`.

  With the release of Custom Domains for workers, users can publish directly to a custom domain on a route, rather than creating a dummy DNS record first and manually pointing the worker over - this adds the same support to wrangler.

  Users declare routes as normal, but to indicate that a route should be treated as a custom domain, a user simply uses the object format in the toml file, but with a new key: custom_domain (i.e. `routes = [{ pattern = "api.example.com", custom_domain = true }]`)

  When wrangler sees a route like this, it peels them off from the rest of the routes and publishes them separately, using the /domains api. This api is very defensive, erroring eagerly if there are conflicts in existing Custom Domains or managed DNS records. In the case of conflicts, wrangler prompts for confirmation, and then retries with parameters to indicate overriding is allowed.

  On Windows, the following command `wrangler pages dev -- foo bar` would error

  When we start up the CLI, we check what the minimum version of supported node is, and throw an error if it isn't at least 16.7. However, the script that runs this, imports `node:child_process` and `node:path`, which was only introduced in 16.7. It was backported to older versions of node, but only in last updates to majors. So for example, if someone used 14.15.4, the script would throw because it wouldn't be able to find `node:child_process` (but it _would_ work on v14.19.2).

  We detect whether a worker is a "modules" format worker by the presence of a `default` export. This is a pretty good heuristic overall, but sometimes folks can make mistakes. One situation that's popped up a few times, is people writing exports, but still writing it in "service worker" format. We detect this fine, and log a warning about the exports, but send it up with the exports included. Unfortunately, our runtime throws when we mark a worker as a service worker, but still has exports. This patch fixes it so that the exports are not included in a service-worker worker.

  Note that if you're missing an event listener, it'll still error with "No event handlers were registered. This script does nothing." but that's a better error than the SyntaxError _even when the listener was there_.

  During `dev` we log the method/url/statuscode for every req+res. This fix logs the correct details for every request.

  The TOML parser that Wrangler uses crashes if there is a Windows line-ending in a comment.
  See https://github.com/iarna/iarna-toml/issues/33.

  According to the TOML spec, we should be able to normalize line-endings as we see fit.
  See https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#:~:text=normalize%20newline%20to%20whatever%20makes%20sense.

  This change normalizes line-endings of TOML strings before parsing to avoid hitting this bug.

  This patch modifies the terminal when running `wrangler init`, to show the proper paths of files created during it (like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc etc). It also fixes a bug where we weren't detecting the existence of `src/index.js` for a named worker before asking to create it.

  When running `wrangler.init`, we look for the existence of `package.json`, / `tsconfig.json` / `.git` when deciding whether we should create them ourselves or not. Because `name` can be a relative path, we had a bug where we don't starting look from the right directory. We also had a bug where we weren't even testing for the existence of the `.git` directory correctly. This patch fixes that initial starting location, tests for `.git` as a directory, and correctly decides when to create those files.

  Worker projects created by `wrangler init` should also be managed by source control (popularly, git). This patch adds a choice in `wrangler init` to make the created project into a git repository.

  Additionally, this fixes a bug in our tests where mocked `confirm()` and `prompt()` calls were leaking between tests.

  The `--site` option is no longer supported.
  This change adds information about how to create a new Sites project
  by cloning a repository.
  It also adds links to the Worker Sites and Cloudflare Pages docs.

* [#908](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/908) [`f8dd31e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/f8dd31e322774180b371c6af15b4bfbd92a58284) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: fix isolate prewarm logic for `wrangler dev`

  When calling `wrangler dev`, we make a request to a special URL that "prewarms" the isolate running our Worker so that we can attach devtools etc to it before actually making a request. We'd implemented it wrongly, and because we'd silenced its errors, we weren't catching it. This patch fixes the logic (based on wrangler 1.x's implementation) and enables logging errors when the prewarm request fails.

  As a result, profiling starts working again as expected. Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/907

- [#919](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/919) [`13078e1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/13078e147f49c5054fc87dc4ab5a5f2028b93f5a) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: don't crash when tail event is null

  Sometime the "event" on a tail can be null. This patch makes sure we don't crash when that happens. Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/918

* [#913](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/913) [`dfeed74`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/dfeed74ee4c07d1e3c2e1b91ad5ccaa68fc9c120) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - polish: add a deprecation warning to `--inspect` on `dev`

  We have a blogposts and docs that says you need to pass `--inspect` to use devtools and/or profile your Worker. In wrangler v2, we don't need to pass the flag anymore. Using it right now will throw an error, so this patch makes it a simple warning instead.

  When errors in wrangler happen, it's hard to tell where the error is coming from in a minified bundle. This patch removes the minification. We still set `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'` in the bundle so we don't run dev-only paths in things like React.

  This adds about 2 mb to the bundle, but imo it's worth it.

  Allows wrangler2 to perform preview & dev sessions with a different bucket than the published worker's binding.

  This matches kv's preview_id behavior, and brings the wrangler2 implementation in sync with wrangler1.

  We haven't found much use for sourcemaps in production, and we should probably minify the bundle anyway. This will also remove an dev only warnings react used to log.

  Added a check in non-TTY environments for `account_id`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. If `account_id` exists in `wrangler.toml`
  then `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is not needed in non-TTY scope. The `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is necessary in non-TTY scope and will always error if missing.

  Instead of logging "Unrecognised input" when hitting return/enter in a confirm dialog, we should accept it as a confirmation. This patch also makes the default choice "y" bold in the dialog.

  The `vars` bindings can be specified in the `wrangler.toml` configuration file.
  But "secret" `vars` are usually only provided at the server -
  either by creating them in the Dashboard UI, or using the `wrangler secret` command.

  It is useful during development, to provide these types of variable locally.
  When running `wrangler dev` we will look for a file called `.dev.vars`, situated
  next to the `wrangler.toml` file (or in the current working directory if there is no
  `wrangler.toml`). Any values in this file, formatted like a `dotenv` file, will add to
  or override `vars` bindings provided in the `wrangler.toml`.

  This means that running `wrangler init .` will create a worker in the current directory,

  This adds an experimental node.js compatibility mode. It can be enabled by adding `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`, or by passing `--node-compat` as a command line arg for `dev`/`publish` commands. This is currently powered by `@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill` (which in itself is powered by `rollup-plugin-node-polyfills`).

  We'd previously added this, and then removed it because the quality of the polyfills isn't great. We're reintroducing it regardless so we can start getting feedback on its usage, and it sets up a foundation for replacing it with our own, hopefully better maintained polyfills.

  Of particular note, this means that what we promised in https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-stripe-support-in-workers/ now actually works.

  Certain runtime APIs are only available to workers during the "request context",
  which is any code that returns after receiving a request and before returning
  a response.

  Miniflare emulates this behavior by using an [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) and
  [checking at runtime](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/blob/master/packages/shared/src/context.ts#L21-L36)
  to see if you're using those APIs during the request context.

  In certain environments `AsyncLocalStorage` is unavailable, such as in a
  [webcontainer](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core).
  This function figures out if we're able to run those "request context" checks
  and returns [a set of options](https://miniflare.dev/core/standards#global-functionality-limits)

  This removes the timeout we have for custom builds. We shouldn't be applying this timeout anyway, since it doesn't block wrangler, just the user themselves. Further, in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/759, we changed the custom build's process stdout/stderr config to "pipe" to pass tests, however that meant we wouldn't see logs in the terminal anymore.

  - passes the correct query param to check whether a workers.dev subdomain has already been published/enabled
  - thus enabling it only when it's not been enabled
  - it also disables it only when it's explicitly knows it's already been enabled

  The effect of this is that publishes are much faster.

  There's some interference between our data fetching library `undici` and node 18's new `fetch` and co. (powered by `undici` internally) which replaces the filename of `File`s attached to `FormData`s with a generic `blob` (likely this code - https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/615f6170f4bd39630224c038d1ea5bf505d292af/lib/fetch/formdata.js#L246-L250). It's still not clear why it does so, and it's hard to make an isolated example of this.

  Regardless, disabling the new `fetch` functionality makes `undici` use its own base classes, avoiding the problem for now, and unblocking our release. We'll keep investigating and look for a proper fix.

  It can be useful to do a dry run of publishing. Developers want peace of mind that a project will compile before actually publishing to live servers. Combined with `--outdir`, this is also useful for testing the output of `publish`. Further, it gives developers a chance to upload our generated sourcemap to a service like sentry etc, so that errors from the worker can be mapped against actual source code, but before the service actually goes live.

  With `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` in `dev`, we were clobbering a single folder with data from kv/do/cache. This patch gives individual folders for them. It also enables persistence even when this is not true, but that stays only for the length of a session, and cleans itself up when the dev session ends.

  We currently log an `AbortError` with a stack if we exit `wrangler dev`'s startup process before it's done. This fix skips logging that error (since it's not an exception).

  It can be useful to introspect built assets. A leading usecase is to upload the sourcemap that we generate to services like sentry etc, so that errors from the worker can be mapped against actual source code. We introduce a `--outdir` cli arg to specify a path to generate built assets at, which doesn't get cleaned up after publishing. We are _not_ adding this to `wrangler.toml` just yet, but could in the future if it looks appropriate there.

  This enables optionally passing a route as `{pattern: string, zone_id: string}`. There are scenarios where we need to explicitly pass a zone_id to the api, so this enables that.

  Some nuance: The errors from the api aren't super useful when invalid values are passed, but that's something to further work on.

  This sets up `--experiment-enable-local-persistence` to explicitly use `process.cwd() + wrangler-local-state` as a path to store values.

  If a user hasn't logged in and then they run a command that needs a login they'll get bounced to the login flow.
  The login flow (if completed) would write their shiny new OAuth2 credentials to disk, but wouldn't reload the
  in-memory state. This led to issues like #693, where even though the user was logged in on-disk, wrangler
  wouldn't be aware of it.

  When the `Remote` component is unmounted, we now signal outstanding `fetch()` requests, and
  `waitForPortToBeAvailable()` tasks to cancel them. This prevents unexpected requests from appearing
  after the component has been unmounted, and also allows the process to exit cleanly without a delay.

  When a developer uses `--env` to specify an environment name, the Worker name should
  be computed from the top-level Worker name and the environment name.

  When the given environment name does not match those in the wrangler.toml, we error.
  But if no environments have been specified in the wrangler.toml, at all, then we only
  log a warning and continue.

  In this second case, we were reusing the top-level environment, which did not have the
  correct legacy environment fields set, such as the name. Now we ensure that such an
  environment is created as needed.

  When `workers_dev` is not configured, we had a bug where it would default to true inside an environment even when there were routes defined, thus publishing both to a `workers.dev` subdomain as well as the defined routes. The fix is to default `workers_dev` to `undefined`, and check when publishing whether or not to publish to `workers.dev`/defined routes.

  - We consider jsx to be regular js, and have setup our esbuild process to process js/mjs/cjs files as jsx.
  - We use a separate esbuild run on an entry point file when trying to guess the worker format, but hadn't setup the loaders there.
  - So if just the entrypoint file has any jsx in it, then we error because it can't parse the code.

  The fix is to add the same loaders to the esbuild run that guesses the worker format.

  Continuing the work from https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/325, this detects when wrangler is running inside an environment where "raw" mode is not available on stdin, and disables the features for hot keys and the shortcut bar.

  We don't want to have, for example, a KV namespace named "DATA"
  and a Durable Object also named "DATA". Then it would be ambiguous
  what exactly would live at `env.DATA` (or in the case of service workers,
  the `DATA` global) which could lead to unexpected behavior -- and errors.

  Similarly, we don't want to have multiple resources of the same type
  bound to the same name. If you've been working with some KV namespace
  called "DATA", and you add a second namespace but don't change the binding
  to something else (maybe you're copying-and-pasting and just changed out the `id`),
  you could be reading entirely the wrong stuff out of your KV store.

  So now we check for those sorts of situations and throw an error if
  we find that we've encountered one.

  An extremely common pattern in the js ecosystem is to add additional behaviour gated by the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV`. For example, React leverages it heavily to add dev-time checks and warnings/errors, and to load dev/production versions of code. By doing this substitution ourselves, we can get a significant runtime boost in libraries/code that leverage this.

  This does NOT tackle the additional features of either minification, or proper node compatibility, or injecting wrangler's own environment name, which we will tackle in future PRs.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/633, we missed passing a cwd to the process that runs the miniflare cli.

  Now, when we normalize and validate the raw config, we pass in the currently
  active environment name, and the config that is returned contains all the
  environment fields correctly normalized (including inheritance) at the top
  level of the config object. This avoids other commands from having to check
  both the current named environment and the top-level config for such fields.

  Also, now, handle the case where the active environment name passed in via the
  `--env` command line argument does not match any of the named environments
  in the configuration:

  - This is an error if there are named environments configured;
  - or only a warning if there are no named environments configured.

  Previously, asset file paths were computed relative to the current working

  When implementing legacy module specifiers, we didn't throughly test the interaction when there weren't any other files next to the entry worker, and importing npm modules.

  We rely on Chromium-based devtools for debugging workers, so when opening up the devtools URL,

  This consolidates some logic into `getEntry()`, namely including `guessWorkerFormat()` and custom builds. This simplifies the code for both `dev` and `publish`.

  - Previously, the implementation of custom builds inside `dev` assumed it could be a long running process; however it's not (else consider that `publish` would never work).
  - By running custom builds inside `getEntry()`, we can be certain that the entry point exists as we validate it and before we enter `dev`/`publish`, simplifying their internals
  - We don't have to do periodic checks inside `wrangler dev` because it's now a one shot build (and always should have been)
  - This expands test coverage a little for both `dev` and `publish`.
  - The 'format' of a worker is intrinsic to its contents, so it makes sense to establish its value inside `getEntry()`
  - This also means less async logic inside `<Dev/>`, which is always a good thing

  This implements wrangler 1.x style module specifiers, but also logs a deprecation warning for every usage.

  Consider a project like so:

  ```
    project
    ├── index.js
    └── some-dependency.js
  ```

  where the content of `index.js` is:

  ```jsx
  import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";
  addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  	// ...
  });
  ```

  `wrangler` 1.x would resolve `import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";` to the file `some-dependency.js`. This will work in `wrangler` v2, but it will log a deprecation warning. Instead, you should rewrite the import to specify that it's a relative path, like so:

  ```diff
  - import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";
  + import SomeDependency from "./some-dependency.js";
  ```

  In a near future version, this will become a breaking deprecation and throw an error.

  (This also updates `workers-chat-demo` to use the older style specifier, since that's how it currently is at https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo)

  Known issue: This might not work as expected with `.js`/`.cjs`/`.mjs` files as expected, but that's something to be fixed overall with the module system.

  This is an alternate fix to https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/pull/205, and fixes the error where miniflare would get confused resolving relative modules on macs because of `/var`/`/private/var` being symlinks. Instead, we `realpathSync` the bundle path before passing it on to miniflare, and that appears to fix the problem.

  Sentry's SDK automatically tracks "breadcrumbs", which are pieces of information
  that get tracked leading up to an exception. This can be useful for debugging
  errors because it gives better insight into what happens before an error occurs,
  so you can more easily understand and recreate exactly what happened before an
  error occurred.

  Unfortunately, Sentry automatically includes all `console` statements. And since
  we use the console a lot (e.g. logging every request received in `wrangler dev`),
  this is mostly useless. Additionally, since developers frequently use the console
  to debug their workers we end up with a bunch of data that is not only irrelevant
  to the reported error, but also contains data that could be potentially sensitive.

  For now, we're turning off breadcrumbs entirely. Later, we might wish to add our
  own breadcrumbs manually (e.g. add a "wrangler dev" breadcrumb when a user runs
  `wrangler dev`), at which point we can selectively enable breadcrumbs to catch
  only the ones we've put in there ourselves.

  This change adds full support for the setting the protocol that the localhost proxy server listens to.
  Previously, it was only possible to use `HTTP`. But now you can set it to `HTTPS` as well.

  To support `HTTPS`, Wrangler needs an SSL certificate.
  Wrangler now generates a self-signed certificate, as needed, and caches it in the `~/.wrangler/local-cert` directory.
  These certificates expire after 30 days and are regenerated by Wrangler as needed.

  Note that if you use HTTPS then your browser will complain about the self-signed and you must tell it to accept the certificate before it will let you access the page.

  Previously, the `useLocalWorker()` hook was being passed the wrong port for the `inspectorPort` prop.

  which also means that `Remote` benefits from this check too.

  This expires any previously uploaded assets when using a Sites / `[site]` configuration. Because we currently do a full iteration of a namespace's keys when publishing, for rapidly changing sites this means that uploads get slower and slower. We can't just delete unused assets because it leads to occasional 404s on older publishes while we're publishing. So we expire previous assets while uploading new ones. The implementation/constraints of the kv api means that uploads may become slower, but should hopefully be faster overall. These optimisations also only matter for rapidly changing sites, so common usecases still have the same perf characteristics.

  Now one should use `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_BASE_URL` rather than `CF_API_TOKEN`, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_API_BASE_URL`, which have been deprecated.

  If you use the deprecated variables they will still work but you will see a warning message.

  Within the Cloudflare tooling ecosystem, we have a mix of `CF_` and `CLOUDFLARE_`
  for prefixing environment variables. Until recently, many of the tools
  were fine with `CF_` however, there started to be conflicts with
  external tools (such as Cloudfoundary CLI), which also uses `CF_` as a
  prefix, and would potentially be reading and writing the same value the
  Cloudflare tooling.

  The Go SDK[1], Terraform[2] and cf-terraforming[3] have made the jump to
  the `CLOUDFLARE_` prefix for environment variable prefix.

  In future, all SDKs will use this prefix for consistency and to allow all the tooling to reuse the same environment variables in the scenario where they are present.

  This implements a top level `main` field for `wrangler.toml` to define an entry point for the worker , and adds a deprecation warning for `build.upload.main`. The deprecation warning is detailed enough to give the exact line to copy-paste into your config file. Example -

  ```
  The `build.upload` field is deprecated. Delete the `build.upload` field, and add this to your configuration file:

  main = "src/chat.mjs"

  We'd originally planned for `--local` mode to be a thing across all wrangler commands. In hindsight, that didn't make much sense, since every command other than `wrangler dev` assumes some interaction with cloudflare and their API. The only command other than dev where this "worked" was `kv`, but even that didn't make sense because wrangler dev wouldn't even read from it. We also have `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` there anyway.

  So this moves the `--local` flag to only apply for `wrangler dev` and removes any trace from other commands.

  This implements support for `[text_blobs]` as defined by https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/1677.

  Text blobs can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in `wrangler.toml` as -

  ```
  [text_blobs]
  MYTEXT = "./path/to/my-text.file"
  ```

  The content of the file will then be available as the global `MYTEXT` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  Workers Sites now uses `[text_blobs]` internally. Previously, we were inlining the asset manifest into the worker itself, but we now attach the asset manifest to the uploaded worker. I also added an additional example of Workers Sites with a modules format worker.

  Previously when running `wrangler dev` on multiple workers at the same time, you couldn't attach DevTools to both workers, since they were both listening on port 9229.
  With this PR, that behavior is improved -- you can now pass an `--inspector-port` flag to specify a port for DevTools to connect to on a per-worker basis, or
  if the option is omitted, wrangler will assign a random unused port for you.

  This "if no option is given, assign a random unused port" behavior has also been added to `wrangler dev --port`, so running `wrangler dev` on two
  workers at once should now "just work". Hopefully.

  The `preview` command is deprecated and not supported in this version of Wrangler.
  Instead, one should use the `dev` command for most `preview` use-cases.

  There was a common chunk of code across most commands that ensures a user is logged in, and retrieves an account ID. I'd resisted making this into an abstraction for a while. Now that the codebase is stable, and https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/537 removes some surrounding code there, I made an abstraction for this common code as `requireAuth()`. This gets a mention in the changelog simply because it touches a bunch of code, although it's mostly mechanical deletion/replacement.

  Currently, when creating a new project, we usually first have to create a directory before running `wrangler init`, since it defaults to creating the `wrangler.toml`, `package.json`, etc in the current working directory. This fix introduces an enhancement, where using the `wrangler init [name]` form creates a directory named `[name]` and initialises the project files inside it. This matches the usage pattern a little better, and still preserves the older behaviour when we're creating a worker inside existing projects.

  The configuration for a Worker is complicated since we can define different "environments", and each environment can have its own configuration.
  There is a default ("top-level") environment and then named environments that provide environment specific configuration.

  This is further complicated by the fact that there are three kinds of environment configuration:

  - **non-overridable**: these values are defined once in the top-level configuration, apply to all environments and cannot be overridden by an environment.
  - **inheritable**: these values can be defined at the top-level but can also be overridden by environment specific values.
    Named environments do not need to provide their own values, in which case they inherit the value from the top-level.
  - **non-inheritable**: these values must be explicitly defined in each environment if they are defined at the top-level.
    Named environments do not inherit such configuration and must provide their own values.

  All configuration values in `wrangler.toml` are optional and will receive a default value if not defined.

  This change adds more strict interfaces for top-level `Config` and `Environment` types,
  as well as validation and normalization of the optional fields that are read from `wrangler.toml`.

  We were warning if you were trying to develop a durable object with an unnamed worker. Further, the internal api would actually throw if you tried to develop with a named worker if it wasn't already published. The latter is being fixed internally and should live soon, and this fix removes the warning completely.

  During `dev` and `publish`, we should resolve `wrangler.toml` starting from the entrypoint, and then working up from there. Currently, we start from the directory from which we call `wrangler`, this changes that behaviour to start from the entrypoint instead.

  (To implement this, I made one big change: Inside commands, we now have to explicitly read configuration from a path, instead of expecting it to 'arrive' coerced into a configuration object.)

Supported options:

  - `--status cancelled --status error` --> you can filter on `ok`, `error`, and `cancelled` to only tail logs that have that status
  - `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER:somevalue` --> you can filter on headers, including ones that have specific values (`"somevalue"`) or just that contain any header (e.g. `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER` with no colon)
  - `--method POST --method PUT` --> filter on the HTTP method used to trigger the worker
  - `--search catch-this` --> only shows messages that contain the phrase `"catch-this"`. Does not (yet!) support regular expressions
  - `--ip self --ip 192.0.2.232` --> only show logs from requests that originate from the given IP addresses. `"self"` will be replaced with the IP address of the computer that sent the tail request.

  This formalises the logic we use to "guess"/infer what a worker's format is - either "modules" or "service worker". Previously we were using the output of the esbuild process metafile to infer this, we now explicitly do so in a separate step (esbuild's so fast that it doesn't have any apparent performance hit, but we also do a simpler form of the build to get this information).

  This also adds `--format` as a command line arg for `publish`.

  Adds support for "unsafe bindings", that is, bindings that aren't supported by wrangler, but are
  desired when uploading a Worker to Cloudflare. This allows you to use beta features before
  official support is added to wrangler, while also letting you migrate to proper support for the
  feature when desired. Note: these bindings may not work everywhere, and may break at any time.

  We open browser windows for a few things; during `wrangler dev`, and logging in. There are environments where this doesn't work as expected (like codespaces, stackblitz, etc).

  Now that we have `[[unsafe.bindings]]` (as of https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/411), we should use that for experimental features. This removes support for `[experimental_services]`, and adds a helpful message for how to rewrite their configuration.

  This error is temporary, until the internal teams that were using this rewrite their configs. We'll remove it before GA.

  What the error looks like -

  ```
  Error: The "experimental_services" field is no longer supported. Instead, use [[unsafe.bindings]] to enable experimental features. Add this to your wrangler.toml:

  [[unsafe.bindings]]
  name = "SomeService"
  type = "service"
  service = "some-service"

  Environment:
  OS/arch
  node/npm versions
  wrangler version
  RewriteFrames relative pathing of stacktrace and will prevent user file system information
  from being sent.

  Sourcemaps:

  - The sourcemap custom scripts for path matching in Artifact, Sentry Event and Build output is moved to be handled in GH Actions
    Sentry upload moved after changeset version bump script and npm script to get current version into GH env variable
  - Add org and project to secrets for increased obfuscation of Cloudflare internal ecosystem

  Prompt for Opt-In:

  - When Error is thrown user will be prompted with yes (only sends this time), Always, and No (default). Always and No
    will be added to default.toml with a datetime property for future update checks.
  - If the property already exists it will skip the prompt.

  Sentry Tests:
  The tests currently check that the decision flow works as currently set up then checks if Sentry is able
  to send events or is disabled.

  wasm modules can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in wrangler.toml as -

  ```
  [wasm_modules]
  MYWASM = "./path/to/my-wasm.wasm"
  ```

  The module will then be available as the global `MYWASM` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  (In the future, we MAY enable wasm module imports in service-worker format (i.e. `import MYWASM from './path/to/my-wasm.wasm'`) and global imports inside modules format workers.)

  This change introduces three new commands, which manage buckets under the current account:

  - `r2 buckets list`: list information about all the buckets.
  - `r2 buckets create`: create a new bucket - will error if the bucket already exists.
  - `r2 buckets delete`: delete a bucket.

  This brings Wrangler 2 inline with the same features in Wrangler 1.

  This adds an error when we use an entry point that doesn't exist, either for `wrangler dev` or `wrangler publish`, and either via cli arg or `build.upload.main` in `wrangler.toml`. By using a common abstraction for `dev` and `publish`, This also adds support for using `build.config.main`/`build.config.dir` for `wrangler dev`.

  In e151223 we introduced a bug where the RouteKey was now an array rather than a simple URL string. When it got stringified into the routing object these were invalid.

  The api for fetching a kv value, unlike every other cloudflare api, returns just the raw value as a string (as opposed to the `FetchResult`-style json). However, our fetch utility tries to convert every api response to json before parsing it further. This leads to bugs like https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/359. The fix is to special case for `kv:key get`.

  Previously, when we initialized a project using `wrangler init`, we always used npm as the package manager.

  - Don't rely on bash variables to configure tests
    The use of bash variables in the `npm test` script is not supported in Windows Powershell, causing CI on Windows to fail.
    These bash variables are used to override the API token and the Account ID.

    This change moves the control of mocking these two concepts into the test code, by adding `mockAccountId()` and `mockApiToken()` helpers.

    - The result is slightly more boilerplate in tests that need to avoid hitting the auth APIs.
    - But there are other tests that had to revert these environment variables. So the boilerplate is reduced there.

  - Sanitize command line for snapshot tests
    This change applies `normalizeSlashes()` and `trimTimings()` to command line outputs and error messages to avoid inconsistencies in snapshots.
    The benefit here is that authors do not need to keep adding them to all their snapshot tests.

  - Move all the helper functions into their own directory to keep the test directory cleaner.

  Previously in pages projects using advanced mode (a single `_worker.js` or `--script-path` file rather than a `./functions` folder), calling `pages dev` would quit without an error and not launch miniflare.

  There are several reasons to replace `node-fetch` with `undici`:

  - `undici`'s `fetch()` implementation is set to become node's standard `fetch()` implementation, which means we can just remove the dependency in the future (or optionally load it depending on which version of node is being used)
  - `node-fetch` pollutes the global type space with a number of standard types
  - we already bundle `undici` via `miniflare`/pages, so this means our bundle size could ostensibly become smaller.

  This replaces `node-fetch` with `undici`.

  - All instances of `import fetch from "node-fetch"` are replaced with `import {fetch} from "undici"`
  - `undici` also comes with spec compliant forms of `FormData` and `File`, so we could also remove `formdata-node` in `form_data.ts`
  - All the global types that were injected by `node-fetch` are now imported from `undici` (as well as some mistaken ones from `node:url`)
  - NOTE: this also turns on `skipLibCheck` in `tsconfig.json`. Some dependencies oddly depend on browser globals like `Request`, `Response` (like `@miniflare/core`, `jest-fetch-mock`, etc), which now fail because `node-fetch` isn't injecting those globals anymore. So we enable `skipLibCheck` to bypass them. (I'd thought `skipLibCheck` completely ignores 'third party' types, but that's not true - it still uses the module graph to scan types. So we're still typesafe. We should enable `strict` sometime to avoid `any`s, but that's for later.)
  - The bundle size isn't smaller because we're bundling 2 different versions of `undici`, but we'll fix that by separately upping the version of `undici` that miniflare bundles.

  - This adds `eslint-plugin-import` to enforce ordering of imports, and configuration for the same in `package.json`.
  - I also run `npm run check:lint -- --fix` to apply the configured order in our whole codebase.
  - This also needs a setting in `.vscode/settings.json` to prevent spurious warnings inside vscode. You'll probably have to restart your IDE for this to take effect. (re: https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2377#issuecomment-1024800026)

  (I'd also like to enforce using `node:` prefixes for node builtin modules, but that can happen later. For now I manually added the prefixes wherever they were missing. It's not functionally any different, but imo it helps the visual grouping.)

  This adds support for `*.wasm` modules into local mode for `wrangler dev`.

  In 'edge' mode, we create a javascript bundle, but wasm modules are uploaded to the preview server directly when making the worker definition form upload. However, in 'local' mode, we need to have the actual modules available to the bundle. So we copy the files over to the bundle path. We also pass appropriate `--modules-rule` directive to `miniflare`.

  I also added a sample wasm app to use for testing, created from a default `workers-rs` project.

  Previously we were caching all the `node_modules` files in the CI jobs and then running `npm install`. While this resulted in slightly improved install times on Ubuntu, it breaks on Windows because the npm workspace setup adds symlinks into node_modules, which the Github cache action cannot cope with.

  This change removes the `node_modules` caches (saving some time by not needing to restore them) and replaces `npm install` with `npm ci`.

  The `npm ci` command is actually designed to be used in CI jobs as it only installs the exact versions specified in the `package-lock.json` file, guaranteeing that for any commit we always have exactly the same CI job run, deterministically.

  It turns out that, on Ubuntu, using `npm ci` makes very little difference to the installation time (~30 secs), especially if there is no `node_modules` there in the first place.

  Unfortunately, MacOS is slower (~1 min), and Windows even worse (~2 mins)! But it is worth this longer CI run to be sure we have things working on all OSes.

  This fix passes the correct worker name to `syncAssets` during `wrangler dev`. This function uses the name to create the backing kv store for a Workers Sites definition, so it's important we get the name right.

  I also fixed the lint warning introduced in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/321, to pass `props.enableLocalPersistence` as a dependency in the `useEffect` call that starts the "local" mode dev server.

  When fetching a list of results from cloudflare APIs (e.g. when fetching a list of keys in a kv namespace), the api returns a `cursor` that a consumer should use to get the next 'page' of results. It appears this cursor can also be a blank string (while we'd only account for it to be `undefined`). By only accounting for it to be `undefined`, we were infinitely looping through the same page of results and never terminating. This PR fixes it by letting it be a blank string (and `null`, for good measure)

- [#332](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/332) [`a2155c1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/a2155c1ec65e271e4a5be1a19717b1aebdd647a5) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: wait for port to be available before creating a dev server

  When we run `wrangler dev`, we start a server on a port (defaulting to 8787). We do this separately for both local and edge modes. However, when switching between the two with the `l` hotkey, we don't 'wait' for the previous server to stop before starting the next one. This can crash the process, and we don't want that (of course). So we introduce a helper function `waitForPortToBeAvailable()` that waits for a port to be available before returning. This is used in both the local and edge modes, and prevents the bug right now, where switching between edge - local - edge crashes the process.

  (This isn't a complete fix, and we can still cause errors by very rapidly switching between the two modes. A proper long term fix for the future would probably be to hoist the proxy server hook above the `<Remote/>` and `<Local/>` components, and use a single instance throughout. But that requires a deeper refactor, and isn't critical at the moment.)

  We were adding text-like modules (i.e. `.txt`, `.html` and `.pem` files) as separate modules in the Worker definition, but this only really 'works' with the ES module Worker format. This commit changes that to inline the text-like files into the Worker bundle directly.

  We still have to do something similar with `.wasm` modules, but that requires a different fix, and we'll do so in a subsequent commit.

  This adds support for Workers Sites in local mode when running wrangler `dev`.

  This PR implements `wrangler secret` for `--local` mode. The implementation is simply a no-op, since we don't want to actually write secret values to disk (I think?).

  When we run `wrangler dev`, the session that we setup with the preview endpoint doesn't last forever, it dies after ignoring it for 5-15 minutes or so. The fix for this is to simply reconnect the server. So we use a state hook as a sigil, and add it to the dependency array of the effect that sets up the server, and simply change it every time the server closes.

  We were using `--prefer-offline` when running `npm install` during `wrangler init`. The behaviour is odd, it doesn't seem to fetch from the remote when the cache isn't hit, which is not what I'm expecting. So we remove `--prefer-offline`.

  We were running custom builds as a regular command with `execa`. This would fail whenever we tried to run compound commands like `cargo install -q worker-build && worker-build --release` (via https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/236). The fix is to use `shell: true`, so that the command is run in a shell and can thus use bash-y syntax like `&&`, and so on. I also switched to using `execaCommand` which splits a command string into parts correctly by itself.

  - pipes stdio back to the terminal so there's feedback when it's installing npm packages

  This does have the side effect of making out tests slower. I added `--prefer-offline` to the `npm install` calls to make this a shade quicker, but I can't figure out a good way of mocking these. I'll think about it some more later. We should work on making the installs themselves quicker (re: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/66)

  This PR also fixes a bug with our tests - `runWrangler` would catch thrown errors, and if we didn't manually verify the error, tests would pass. Instead, it now throws correctly, and I modified all the tests to assert on thrown errors. It seems like a lot, but it was just mechanical rewriting.

  This PR adds more special logic for some data types that get logged via `console` methods. Types like `Promise`, `Date`, `WeakMaps`, and some more, now get logged correctly (or at least, better than they used to).

  This PR also fixes a sinister bug - the `type` of the `ConsoleAPICalled` events don't match 1:1 with actual console methods (eg: `console.warn` message type is `warning`). This PR adds a mapping between those types and method names. Some methods don't seem to have a message type, I'm not sure why, but we'll get to them later.

  When we pass a non-js file as entry to esbuild, it generates a `.js` file. (which, is the whole job of esbuild, haha). So, given `<source>/index.ts`, it'll generate `<destination>/index.js`. However, when we try to 'find' the matching file to pass on as an input to creating the actual worker, we try to use the original file name inside the destination directory. At this point, the extension has changed, so it doesn't find the file, and hence we get the error that looks like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/folders/3f/fwp6mt7n13bfnkd5vl3jmh1w0000gp/T/tmp-61545-4Y5kwyNI8DGU/src/worker.ts'`

  The actual path to the destination file is actually the key of the block in `metafile.outputs` that matches the given output.entryPoint, so this PR simply rewrites the logic to use that instead.

  Any errors embedded in the response from the Cloudflare API were being lost, because `fetchInternal()` would throw on a non-200 response. This PR fixes that behaviour:

  - It doesn't throw on non-200 responses
  - It first gets the response text with `.text()` and converts it to an object with `JSON.parse`, so in case the api returns a non json response, we don't lose response we were sent.

  Unfortunately, because of the nature of this abstraction, we do lose the response `status` code and `statusText`, but maybe that's acceptable since we have richer error information in the payload. I considered logging the code and text to the terminal, but that may make it noisy.

  The `publish` command was failing when the entry-point was specified in the wrangler.toml file and the entry-point imported another file.

  This was because we were using the `metafile.inputs` to guess the entry-point file path. But the order in which the source-files were added to this object was not well defined, and so we could end up failing to find a match.

  This fix avoids this by using the fact that the `metadata.outputs` object will only contain one element that has the `entrypoint` property - and then using that as the entry-point path. For runtime safety, we now assert that there cannot be zero or multiple such elements.

  This PR refactors how we setup the proxy server between the developer and the edge preview service during `wrangler dev`. Of note, we start the server immediately. We also buffer requests/streams and hold on to them, when starting/refreshing the token. This means a developer should never see `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error page, or have an older worker respond after making a change to the code. And when the token does get refreshed, we flush said streams/requests with the newer values, making the iteration process a lot smoother and predictable.

  - I've installed devtools-protocol, a convenient package that has the static types for the devtools protocol (duh) autogenerated from chrome's devtools codebase.
  - We now log messages and exceptions into the terminal directly, so you don't have to open devtools to see those messages.
  - Messages are now buffered until a devtools instance connects, so you won't lose any messages while devtools isn't connected.
  - We don't lose the connection on making changes to the worker, removing the need for the kludgy hack on the devtools side (where we refresh the whole page when there's a change)

  When doing a list request to the API, the server may respond with only a single page of results.
  In this case, it will also provide a `cursor` value in the `result_info` part of the response, which can be used to request the next page.
  This change implements this on the client-side so that we get all the results by requesting further pages when there is a cursor.

### Patch Changes

- 1fdcfe3: Subfolder Relative Pathing Fix issue #147
  The filename from args didn't handle relative paths passed in from users with scripts in subfolders.
  To handle the subfolder pathing a path.relative using cwd() to user input filepath to the filepath variable passed into Dev
- 0330ecf: Adds the Content-Type header when serving assets with `wrangler pages dev`. It guesses the mime-type based on the asset's file extension.
- eaf40e8: Improve the error message for bad `kv:namespace delete` commands
- 562d3ad: chore: enable eslint's no-shadow rule
- 9cef492: Adds the logic of @cloudflare/pages-functions-compiler directly into wrangler. This generates a Worker from a folder of functions.

  Also adds support for sourcemaps and automatically watching dependents to trigger a re-build.

- 3426c13: fix: prevent `useWorker`'s inifinite restarts during `dev`
- e9a1820: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.5`
- 7156e39: Pass bindings correctly to miniflare/child_process.spawn in `dev`, to prevent miniflare from erroring out on startup
- ce2d7d1: Add experimental support for worker-to-worker service bindings. This introduces a new field in configuration `experimental_services`, and serialises it when creating and uploading a worker definition. This is highly experimental, and doesn't work with `wrangler dev` yet.
- 072566f: Fixed KV getNamespaceId preview flag bug
- 5856807: Improve validation message for `kv:namespace create`

  Previously, if the user passed multiple positional arguments (which is invalid)
  the error message would suggest that these should be grouped in quotes.
  But this is also wrong, since a namespace binding name must not contain spaces.

- 34ad323: Refactor the way we convert configurations for bindings all the way through to the API where we upload a worker definition. This commit preserves the configuration structure (mostly) until the point we serialise it for the API. This prevents the way we use duck typing to detect a binding type when uploading, makes the types a bit simpler, and makes it easier to add other types of bindings in the future (notably, the upcoming service bindings.)

### Patch Changes

- 421f2e4: Update base version to 0.0.5, copy the README to packages/wrangler

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- cea27fe: don't log file contents when writing via `kv:key put <key> --path <path>`
- b53cbc8: CI/CD
  - Release flow triggered on PR's closed
- 43e7a82: When using `wrangler pages dev`, enable source maps and log unhandled rejections
- c716abc: Error and exit if the `--type` option is used for the `init` command.

  The `--type` option is no longer needed, nor supported.

  The type of a project is implicitly javascript, even if it includes a wasm (e.g. built from rust).

  Projects that would have had the `webpack` type need to be configured separately to have a custom build.

- 3752acf: Add support for websockets in `dev`, i.e. when developing workers. This replaces the proxy layer that we use to connect to the 'edge' during preview mode, using the `faye-wesocket` library.
- c7bee70: Patches typing mismatches between us, undici and miniflare when proxying requests in pages dev, and also adds fallback 404 behavior which was missed
- 8b6c2d1: Add more fields to the `tsconfig.json` generated by `wrangler init`
- 78cd080: Custom builds for `dev` and `publish`
- cd05d20: import text file types into workers
- 1216fc9: Export regular functions from dialog.ts, pass tests (followup from https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/124)
- 6fc4c50: Display error message when unknown command is provided to the wrangler CLI.
- 23543fe: Allow the developer to exit `init` if there is already a toml file
- 1df6b0c: enable @typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises, pass lint+type check
- 3c5725f: CI/CD Cleanup
  - Removed the build step from tests, which should speed up the "Tests" Workflow.
  - Added a branch specific trigger for "Release", now the Workflow for "Release" should only work on PRs closed to `main`
  - Removed the "Changeset PR" Workflow. Now the "Release" Workflow will handle everything needed for Changesets.
- fb0eae7: support importing `.wasm` files / `workers-rs` support
- e928f94: Improve support for package exports conditionals, including "worker" condition
- 43e7a82: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.4`
- f473942: Replaces the static asset server with a more faithful simulation of what happens with a production Pages project.

  Also improves error handling and automatically opens the browser when running `wrangler pages dev`.

# wrangler

## 3.62.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5950](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5950) [`0075621`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/007562109b583adb6ae15bba5f50029735af24e5) Thanks [@WalshyDev](https://github.com/WalshyDev)! - feat: add `wrangler versions secret put`, `wrangler versions secret bulk` and `wrangler versions secret list`

  `wrangler versions secret put` allows for you to add/update a secret even if the latest version is not fully deployed. A new version with this secret will be created, the existing secrets and config are copied from the latest version.

  `wrangler versions secret bulk` allows you to bulk add/update multiple secrets at once, this behaves the same as `secret put` and will only make one new version.

  `wrangler versions secret list` lists the secrets available to the currently deployed versions. `wrangler versions secret list --latest-version` or `wrangler secret list` will list for the latest version.

  Additionally, we will now prompt for extra confirmation if attempting to rollback to a version with different secrets than the currently deployed.

It will now properly show.

  chore: improve the view of `wrangler versions view` and change up copy a little for `versions secret` commands.

  Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/5964

  For `wrangler dev`, we don't have to check whether certificates have expired when they're provided by the user.

  This commit adds a small QOL improvement to `init` (to be deprecated in the future), for those who still use this wrangler command.

- [#6050](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6050) [`a0c3327`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/a0c3327dd63059d3e24085a95f48f8a98605c49f) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - chore: Normalize more deps

  This is the last of the patches that normalize dependencies across the codebase. In this batch: `ws`, `vitest`, `zod` , `rimraf`, `@types/rimraf`, `ava`, `source-map`, `glob`, `cookie`, `@types/cookie`, `@microsoft/api-extractor`, `@types/mime`, `@types/yargs`, `devtools-protocol`, `@vitest/ui`, `execa`, `strip-ansi`

  This patch also sorts dependencies in every `package.json`

  This is the first of a few expected patches that normalize dependency versions, This normalizes `undici`, `concurrently`, `@types/node`, `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `eslint`, `typescript`. There are no functional code changes (but there are a couple of typecheck fixes).

- [#6046](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6046) [`c643a81`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/c643a8193a3c0739b33d3c0072ae716bc8f1565b) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - chore: Normalize more dependencies.

  Follow up to https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6029, this normalizes some more dependencies : `get-port`, `chalk`, `yargs`, `toucan-js`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `esbuild-register`, `hono`, `glob-to-regexp`, `@cloudflare/workers-types`

- [#6058](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6058) [`31cd51f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/31cd51f251050b0d6db97857a8d1d5427c855d99) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - chore: Quieter builds

  This patch cleans up warnings we were seeing when doing a full build. Specifically:

  - fixtures/remix-pages-app had a bunch of warnings about impending features that it should be upgraded to, so I did that. (tbh this one needs a full upgrade of packages, but we'll get to that later when we're upgrading across the codebase)
  - updated `@microsoft/api-extractor` so it didn't complain that it didn't match the `typescript` version (that we'd recently upgraded)
  - it also silenced a bunch of warnings when exporting types from `wrangler`. We'll need to fix those, but we'll do that when we work on unstable_dev etc.
  - workers-playground was complaining about the size of the bundle being generated, so I increased the limit on it

- [#6043](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6043) [`db66101`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/db661015d37ce75c021413e3ca7c4f0488790cbc) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: avoid esbuild warning when running dev/bundle

  I've been experimenting with esbuild 0.21.4 with wrangler. It's mostly been fine. But I get this warning every time

  ```
  ▲ [WARNING] Import "__INJECT_FOR_TESTING_WRANGLER_MIDDLEWARE__" will always be undefined because there is no matching export in "src/index.ts" [import-is-undefined]

      .wrangler/tmp/bundle-Z3YXTd/middleware-insertion-facade.js:8:23:
        8 │ .....(OTHER_EXPORTS.__INJECT_FOR_TESTING_WRANGLER_MIDDLEWARE__ ?? []),
          ╵
  ```

  This is because esbuild@0.18.5 enabled a warning by default whenever an undefined import is accessed on an imports object. However we abuse imports to inject stuff in `middleware.test.ts`. A simple fix is to only inject that code in tests.

  It turns out that ESBuild paths are case insensitive, which can result in path collisions between polyfills for `globalThis.performance` and `globalThis.Performance`, etc.

  This change ensures that we encode all global names to lowercase and decode them appropriately.

  _This feature is experimental and not yet available for general consumption._

  Use a combination of workerd Node.js builtins (behind the `experimental:nodejs_compat_v2` flag) and
  Unenv polyfills (configured to only add those missing from the runtime) to provide a new more effective
  Node.js compatibility approach.

  When we added the ability to include additional modules in the deployed bundle of a Worker,
  we inadvertently also included some boiler plate code that is only needed at development time.

  This fix ensures that this code is only injected if we are running esbuild in watch mode
  (e.g. `wrangler dev`) and not when building for deployment.

  It is interesting to note that this boilerplate only gets included in the production code
  if there is an import of CommonJS code in the Worker, which esbuild needs to convert to an
  ESM import.

  The experimental "assets" field can be either a string or an object. However the type definition marks it only as an object. This is a problem because we use this to generate the json schema, which gets picked up by vscode's even better toml extension, and shows it to be an error when used with a string (even though it works fine). The fix is to simply change the type definition to add a string variant.

- [#5696](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5696) [`7e97ba8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/7e97ba8778be3cf1d93d44ed191748853c6661e0) Thanks [@geelen](https://github.com/geelen)! - feature: Improved `d1 execute --file --remote` performance & added support for much larger SQL files within a single transaction.

- [#5819](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5819) [`63f7acb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/63f7acb37e7e7ceb60594ac91baf95cd30037d76) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - fix: Show feedback on Pages project deployment failure

  Today, if uploading a Pages Function, or deploying a Pages project fails for whatever reason, there’s no feedback shown to the user. Worse yet, the shown message is misleading, saying the deployment was successful, when in fact it was not:

  ```
  ✨ Deployment complete!
  ```

  This commit ensures that we provide users with:

  - the correct feedback with respect to their Pages deployment
  - the appropriate messaging depending on the status of their project's deployment status
  - the appropriate logs in case of a deployment failure

- [#5814](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5814) [`2869e03`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/2869e0379667d755d1de5543cb80886cc42c211f) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - fix: Display correct global flags in `wrangler pages --help`

  Running `wrangler pages --help` will list, amongst others, the following global flags:

  ```
  -j, --experimental-json-config
  -c, --config
  -e, --env
  -h, --help
  -v, --version
  ```

  This is not accurate, since flags such as `--config`, `--experimental-json-config`, or `env` are not supported by Pages.

  This commit ensures we display the correct global flags that apply to Pages.

- [#5818](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5818) [`df2daf2`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/df2daf2c858229fd812bf1fe818b206ef1345a00) Thanks [@WalshyDev](https://github.com/WalshyDev)! - chore: Deprecate usage of the deployment object on the unsafe metadata binding in favor of the new version_metadata binding.

  If you're currently using the old binding, please move over to the new version_metadata binding by adding:

  ```toml
  [version_metadata]
  binding = "CF_VERSION_METADATA"
  ```

  and updating your usage accordingly. You can find the docs for the new binding here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/version-metadata

  Prior to Wrangler 3.4.0 we displayed an error if the user tried to upload a
  JSON file that contained non-string secrets, since these are not supported
  by the Cloudflare backend.

  This change reintroduces that check to give the user a helpful error message
  rather than a cryptic `workers.api.error.invalid_script_config` error code.

Users should update any parsing to use "Version ID" before "Deployment ID" is removed.

- [#5754](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5754) [`f673c66`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/f673c66373e2acd8d9cc94d5afa87b07dd3d750c) Thanks [@RamIdeas](https://github.com/RamIdeas)! - fix: when using custom builds, the `wrangler dev` proxy server was sometimes left in a paused state

  This could be observed as the browser loading indefinitely, after saving a source file (unchanged) when using custom builds. This is now fixed by ensuring the proxy server is unpaused after a short timeout period.

  Previously, with the following in your `wrangler.toml`, an invalid types file would be generated:

  ```toml

  Today Pages cannot deploy Durable Objects itself. For this reason it is mandatory that when declaring Durable Objects bindings in the config file, the `script_name` is specified. We are currently not failing validation if
  `script_name` is not specified but we should. These changes fix that.

  A regression was introduced in wrangler 3.46.0 (https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5215)
  which made it so that missing `Request#cf` properties are serialized as `"undefined"`, this in turn
  throws a syntax parse error when such values are parsed via `JSON.parse` breaking the communication
  with Durable Object local proxies. Fix such issue by serializing missing `Request#cf` properties as
  `"{}"` instead.

  Param names can only contain alphanumeric and underscore characters. Previously the user would see a confusing error message similar to:

  ```
   TypeError: Unexpected MODIFIER at 8, expected END
  ```

  Now the user is given an error similar to:

  ```
  Invalid Pages function route parameter - "[hyphen-not-allowed]". Parameter names must only contain alphanumeric and underscore characters.

  The current version of the kv:key put command with the --path argument will treat file contents as a string because it is not one of Blob or File when passed to the form helper library. We should turn it into a Blob so it's not mangling inputs.

    },
  };

  export default <ExportedHandler>{
    fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      return new Response("Hello from the default entrypoint!");
    },
  };
  ```

  Up until now, you could only bind to the `default` entrypoint. With this change, you can bind to `EntrypointA` or `entrypointB` too using the new `entrypoint` option:

  ```toml
  [[services]]
  binding = "SERVICE"
  service = "bound"
  entrypoint = "EntrypointA"
  ```

  To bind to named entrypoints with `wrangler pages dev`, use the `#` character:

  ```shell
  $ wrangler pages dev --service=SERVICE=bound#EntrypointA
  ```

  Previously, to get the correct Workers AI API, you needed to wrap your `env.AI` binding with `new Ai()` from `@cloudflare/ai`. This change moves the contents of `@cloudflare/ai` into the Workers runtime itself, meaning `env.AI` is now an instance of `Ai`, without the need for wrapping.

  This command currently requires the `--experimental-versions` flag.

  This command extracts the trigger deployment logic from `wrangler deploy` and allows users to update their currently deployed Worker's triggers without doing another deployment. This is primarily useful for users of `wrangler versions upload` and `wrangler versions deploy` who can then run `wrangler triggers deploy` to apply trigger changes to their currently deployed Worker Versions.

  The command can also be used even if not using the `wrangler versions ...` commands. And, in fact, users are already using it implicitly when running `wrangler deploy`.

  Since the original command was not yet operational, this update does not constitute a breaking change.

  Instead of providing the queue ID as the parameter to `--queue`, users must provide the queue _name_. Under the hood, we will query the Queues API for the queue ID given the queue name.

  1. `r2 bucket event-notification <subcommand>` becomes `r2 bucket notification <subcommand>`
  2. Parameters to `--event-type` use `-` instead of `_` (e.g. `object_create` -> `object-create`)

  In Chrome v123, the auth requests from the browser back to wrangler now first include a CORS OPTIONS preflight request before the expected GET request. Wrangler was able to successfully complete the login with the first (OPTIONS) request, and therefore upon the second (GET) request, errored because the token exchange had already occured and could not be repeated.

  Wrangler now stops processing the OPTIONS request before completing the token exchange and only proceeds on the expected GET request.

  Previously when the tail WebSocket disconnected, e.g. because of an Internet failure,

  `wrangler version` is an undocumented alias for `wrangler --version`. It is being deprecated in favour of the more conventional flag syntax to avoid confusion with a new (upcoming) `wrangler versions` command.

  BREAKING CHANGE (for a beta feature): `wrangler d1 execute` and `wrangler d1 migrations` commands now default `--local` to `true`. When running `wrangler d1 execute` against a remote D1 database, you will need to provide the `--remote` flag.

  Currently if a config file doesn't define any binding nor module, running
  `wrangler types` against such file would not produce a `d.ts` file.

  Producing a `d.ts` file can however still be beneficial as it would define a correct
  env interface (even if empty) that can be expanded/referenced by user code (this can
  be particularly convenient for scaffolding tools that may want to always generate an
  env interface).

  Example:
  Before `wrangler types --env-interface MyEnv` run with an empty `wrangler.toml` file
  would not generate any file, after these change it would instead generate a file with
  the following content:

  ```
  interface MyEnv {
  }

  Previously, requests sent to `wrangler dev` with unconsumed bodies could result in `Network connection lost` errors. This change attempts to work around the issue by ensuring incoming request bodies are drained if they're not used. This is a temporary fix whilst we try to address the underlying issue. Whilst we don't think this change will introduce any other issues, it can be disabled by setting the `WRANGLER_DISABLE_REQUEST_BODY_DRAINING=true` environment variable. Note this fix is only applied if you've enabled Wrangler's bundling—`--no-bundle` mode continues to have the previous behaviour.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4812 we tried to fix the Origin headers to match the Host header but were overzealous and rewrote Origin headers for external origins (outside of the proxy server's origin).

  This is now fixed, and moreover we rewrite any headers that refer to the proxy server on the request with the configured host and vice versa on the response.

  This should ensure that CORS is not broken in browsers when a different host is being simulated based on routes in the Wrangler configuration.

  initially `getBindingsProxy` was supposed to only provide proxies for bindings,

  clarify the increased scope the utility is getting renamed to `getPlatformProxy`
  and its `bindings` field is getting renamed `env`

  The previous Wrangler release introduced a regression that caused reloads to fail when importing `node:*` modules. This change fixes that, and ensures these modules can always be resolved.

## 3.28.0

### Minor Changes

- [#4499](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4499) [`cf9c029b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/cf9c029b30e1db3a1c3f9dc4208b9c34021a8ac0) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - feat: Support runtime-agnostic polyfills

  Previously, Wrangler treated any imports of `node:*` modules as build-time errors (unless one of the two Node.js compatibility modes was enabled). This is sometimes overly aggressive, since those imports are often not hit at runtime (for instance, it was impossible to write a library that worked across Node.JS and Workers, using Node packages only when running in Node). Here's an example of a function that would cause Wrangler to fail to build:

  ```ts
  export function randomBytes(length: number) {
    if (navigator.userAgent !== "Cloudflare-Workers") {
      return new Uint8Array(require("node:crypto").randomBytes(length));
    } else {
      return crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(length));
    }
  }
  ```

  This function _should_ work in both Workers and Node, since it gates Node-specific functionality behind a user agent check, and falls back to the built-in Workers crypto API. Instead, Wrangler detected the `node:crypto` import and failed with the following error:

  ```
  ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "node:crypto"

      src/randomBytes.ts:5:36:
        5 │ ... return new Uint8Array(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(length));
          ╵                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The package "node:crypto" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.
    Add "node_compat = true" to your wrangler.toml file to enable Node.js compatibility.
  ```

  This change turns that Wrangler build failure into a warning, which users can choose to ignore if they know the import of `node:*` APIs is safe (because it will never trigger at runtime, for instance):

  ```
  ▲ [WARNING] The package "node:crypto" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.

    Your Worker may throw errors at runtime unless you enable the "nodejs_compat"
    compatibility flag. Refer to
    https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/ for more details.
    Imported from:
     - src/randomBytes.ts
  ```

  However, in a lot of cases, it's possible to know at _build_ time whether the import is safe. This change also injects `navigator.userAgent` into `esbuild`'s bundle settings as a predefined constant, which means that `esbuild` can tree-shake away imports of `node:*` APIs that are guaranteed not to be hit at runtime, supressing the warning entirely.

  Currently running `wrangler types` against a `wrangler.toml` file without a defined entrypoint (`main` value)
  causes the command to error with the following message:

  ```
  ✘ [ERROR] Missing entry-point: The entry-point should be specified via the command line (e.g. `wrangler types path/to/script`) or the `main` config field.
  ```

  However developers could want to generate types without the entrypoint being defined (for example when using `getBindingsProxy`), so these changes
  make the entrypoint optional for the `types` command, assuming modules syntax if none is specified.

  Previously, when running `wrangler dev`, requests inflight during a UserWorker reload (due to config or source file changes) would fail.

  Now, if those inflight requests are GET or HEAD requests, they will be reproxied against the new UserWorker. This adds to the guarantee that requests made during local development reach the latest worker.

  When Pages is used in conjunction with a full stack framework, the framework
  build will temporarily remove files that are being watched by Pages, such as
  `_worker.js` and `_routes.json`.
  Previously we would display errors for these changes, which adds confusing and excessive messages to the Pages dev output. Now builds are skipped if a watched `_worker.js` or `_routes.json` is removed.

  Previously, running `wrangler r2 objects {get,put}` with an object or bucket that didn't exist would ask if you wanted to report that error to Cloudflare. There's nothing we can do to fix this, so this change prevents the prompt in this case.

  Prior to this PR, if a query threw an error when run in `wrangler d1 execute ... --json`, wrangler would swallow the error.

  This PR returns the error as JSON. For example, the invalid query `SELECT asdf;` now returns the following in JSON mode:

  Previously, when configuring `wrangler pages dev` to use a proxy to a 3rd party dev server,

  If you don't specify `--provider` argument then the command will enter an interactive flow for the user to set the configuration.
  Note that this is a breaking change from the previous behaviour where you could configure AWS as the provider without explictly specifying the `--provider` argument.

  In `wrangler dev` it is possible to set the `upstream_protocol`,
  which is the protocol under which the User Worker believes it has been
  requested, as recorded in the `request.url` that can be used for
  forwarding on requests to the origin.

  Previously, it was not being passed to `wrangler dev` in local mode.
  Instead it was always set to `http`.

  Note that setting `upstream_protocol` to `http` is not supported in
  `wrangler dev` remote mode, which is the case since Wrangler v2.0.

  This setting now defaults to `https` in remote mode (since that is the only option),
  and to the same as `local_protocol` in local mode.

  The new utility is part of wrangler's JS API (it is not part of the wrangler CLI) and its use is to provide proxy objects to bindings, such objects can be used in Node.js code as if they were actual bindings

  The utility reads the `wrangler.toml` file present in the current working directory in order to discern what bindings should be available (a `wrangler.json` file can be used too, as well as config files with custom paths).

  ## Example

  Assuming that in the current working directory there is a `wrangler.toml` file with the following
  content:

  ```
  [[kv_namespaces]]
  binding = "MY_KV"
  id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  ```

  The utility could be used in a nodejs script in the following way:

  Currently, the drive letter of os.homedir() (the user's home directory) is used to build the path to netstat.exe.

  Only specifying the name and type of a binding instructs the patch API to copy the existing binding over - but we were including the contents of the binding as well. Normally that's OK, but there are some subtle differences between what you specify to _create_ a binding vs what it looks like once it's _created_, specifically for Durable Objects. So instead, we just use the simpler inheritance.

  Previously, Wrangler's dev server could change incoming request URLs unexpectedly (e.g. rewriting `http://localhost:8787//test` to `http://localhost:8787/test`). This change ensures URLs are passed through without modification.

  Fixes #4743.

  Previously, if in a `wrangler dev` session you called `console.log()` and threw an unhandled error you'd see an error like `[ERR_ASSERTION]: The expression evaluated to a falsy value`. This change ensures you can do both of these things in the same session.

  Previously, logs containing `at` were always treated as stack trace call sites requiring source mapping. This change updates the call site detection to avoid false positives.

* [#4748](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4748) [`3603a60d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/3603a60d4b06801cf5ce9ee693d467426afa997f) Thanks [@Cherry](https://github.com/Cherry)! - fix: resolve imports in a more node-like fashion for packages that do not declare exports

  Previously, trying to import a file that wasn't explicitly exported from a module would result in an error, but now, better attempts are made to resolve the import using node's module resolution algorithm. It's now possible to do things like this:

  ```js
  import JPEG_DEC_WASM from "@jsquash/jpeg/codec/dec/mozjpeg_dec.wasm";
  ```

  This works even if the `mozjpeg_dec.wasm` file isn't explicitly exported from the `@jsquash/jpeg` module.

  `wrangler@3.19.0` introduced a bug where starting multiple `wrangler dev` sessions with service bindings to each other resulted in a reload loop. This change ensures Wrangler only reloads when dependent `wrangler dev` sessions start/stop.

  Some full-stack frameworks, such as Next.js, check that the Host header for a server
  side action request matches the host where the application is expected to run.

  In `wrangler dev` we have a Proxy Worker in between the browser and the actual User Worker.
  This Proxy Worker is forwarding on the request from the browser, but then the actual User
  Worker is running on a different host:port combination than that which the browser thinks
  it should be on. This was causing the framework to think the request is malicious and blocking
  it.

  Now we update the request's Host header to that passed from the Proxy Worker in a custom `MF-Original-Url`
  header, but only do this if the request also contains a shared secret between the Proxy Worker
  and User Worker, which is passed via the `MF-Proxy-Shared-Secret` header. This last feature is to
  prevent a malicious website from faking the Host header in a request directly to the User Worker.

  Previously, pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or <kbd>x</kbd> when running `wrangler pages dev` wouldn't actually exit `wrangler`. You'd need to press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> a second time to exit the process. This change ensures `wrangler` exits the first time.

  If your Worker fails to deploy because it's too large, Wrangler will display of list of your Worker's largest dependencies. Previously, this just included JavaScript dependencies. This change ensures additional module dependencies (e.g. WebAssembly, text blobs, etc.) are included when computing this list.

  Previously if a Worker failed validation during `wrangler deploy`, the displayed error would reference locations in built JavaScript files. This made it more difficult to debug validation errors. This change ensures these errors are now source mapped, referencing locations in source files instead.

  Previously, if you tried to use `wrangler r2 object get` with an object name containing a `/` or used the `--file` flag with a path containing a `/`, and the specified directory didn't exist, Wrangler would throw an `ENOENT` error. This change ensures Wrangler automatically creates required parent directories if they don't exist.

  Previously, running `wrangler dev` would leave behind "zombie" `workerd` processes. These processes prevented the same port being bound if `wrangler dev` was restarted and sometimes consumed lots of CPU time. This change ensures all `workerd` processes are killed when `wrangler dev` is shutdown.

  To clean-up existing zombie processes, run `pkill -KILL workerd` on macOS/Linux or `taskkill /f /im workerd.exe` on Windows.

  Previously, Wrangler would only apply source mapping to uncaught exceptions. This meant if you caught an exception and logged its stack trace, the call sites would reference built JavaScript files as opposed to source files. This change looks for stack traces in logged messages, and tries to source map them.

  Note source mapping is only applied when outputting logs. `Error#stack` does not return a source mapped stack trace. This means the actual runtime value of `new Error().stack` and the output from `console.log(new Error().stack)` may be different.

  Due to a [known issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/1408), `workerd` will only listen on the IPv4 loopback address `127.0.0.1` when it's asked to listen on `localhost`. On Node.js > 17, `localhost` will resolve to the IPv6 loopback address, meaning requests to `workerd` would fail. This change switches to using the IPv4 loopback address throughout Wrangler on Windows, while [workerd#1408](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/1408) gets fixed.

  Previously, Wrangler listened on all interfaces (`*`) by default. This change switches `wrangler (pages) dev` to just listen on local interfaces.

If you need to access your dev server from another device on your network, you can use `wrangler (pages) dev --ip *` to restore the previous behaviour.

Set a directory or specific .log filepath to write logs to with `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=../Desktop/my-logs/` or `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=../Desktop/my-logs/my-log-file.log`. When specifying a directory or using the default location, a filename with a timestamp is used.

  Wrangler now filters workerd stdout/stderr and marks unactionable messages as debug logs. These debug logs are still observable in the debug log file but will no longer show in the terminal by default without the user setting the env var `WRANGLER_LOG=debug`.

### Minor Changes

- [#4347](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4347) [`102e15f9`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/102e15f9e735ff7506cfff457046137ee7b03c32) Thanks [@Skye-31](https://github.com/Skye-31)! - Feat(unstable_dev): Provide an option for unstable_dev to perform the check that prompts users to update wrangler, defaulting to false. This will prevent unstable_dev from sending a request to NPM on startup to determine whether it needs to be updated.

* [#4179](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4179) [`dd270d00`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/dd270d0065159150ff318f2f06607ddecba6ee9b) Thanks [@matthewdavidrodgers](https://github.com/matthewdavidrodgers)! - Simplify secret:bulk api via script settings

  Firing PUTs to the secret api in parallel has never been a great solution - each request independently needs to lock the script, so running in parallel is at best just as bad as running serially.

  Luckily, we have the script settings PATCH api now, which can update the settings for a script (including secret bindings) at once, which means we don't need any parallelization. However this api doesn't work with a partial list of bindings, so we have to fetch the current bindings and merge in with the new secrets before PATCHing. We can however just omit the value of the binding (i.e. only provide the name and type) which instructs the config service to inherit the existing value, which simplifies this as well. Note that we don't use the bindings in your current wrangler.toml, as you could be in a draft state, and it makes sense as a user that a bulk secrets update won't update anything else. Instead, we use script settings api again to fetch the current state of your bindings.

  This simplified implementation means the operation can only fail or succeed, rather than succeeding in updating some secrets but failing for others. In order to not introduce breaking changes for logging output, the language around "${x} secrets were updated" or "${x} secrets failed" is kept, even if it doesn't make much sense anymore.

  If a compatibility date greater than the installed version of `workerd` was
  configured, a warning would be logged. This warning was only actionable if a new
  version of `wrangler` was available. The intent here was to warn if a user set
  a new compatibility date, but forgot to update `wrangler` meaning changes
  enabled by the new date wouldn't take effect. This change hides the warning if
  no update is available.

  It also changes the default compatibility date for `wrangler dev` sessions
  without a configured compatibility date to the installed version of `workerd`.
  This previously defaulted to the current date, which may have been unsupported
  by the installed runtime.

  Previously, when using wasm (or other static files) from an npm package, you would have to import the file like so:

  ```js
  import wasm from "../../node_modules/svg2png-wasm/svg2png_wasm_bg.wasm";
  ```

  This update now allows you to import the file like so, assuming it's exposed and available in the package's `exports` field:

  ```js
  import wasm from "svg2png-wasm/svg2png_wasm_bg.wasm";
  ```

  This will look at the package's `exports` field in `package.json` and resolve the file using [`resolve.exports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve.exports).

  In Cloudflare for SaaS, custom hostnames of third party domain owners can be used in Cloudflare.
  Workers are allowed to intercept these requests based on the routes configuration.
  Before this change, the same logic used by `wrangler dev` was used in `wrangler deploy`, which caused wrangler to fail with:

  ✘ [ERROR] Could not find zone for [partner-saas-domain.com]

  As Wrangler builds your code, it writes intermediate files to a temporary
  directory that gets cleaned up on exit. Previously, Wrangler used the OS's
  default temporary directory. On Windows, this is usually on the `C:` drive.
  If your source code was on a different drive, our bundling tool would generate
  invalid source maps, breaking breakpoint debugging. This change ensures
  intermediate files are always written to the same drive as sources. It also
  ensures unused build outputs are cleaned up when running `wrangler pages dev`.

  This change also means you no longer need to set `cwd` and
  `resolveSourceMapLocations` in `.vscode/launch.json` when creating an `attach`
  configuration for breakpoint debugging. Your `.vscode/launch.json` should now
  look something like...

  ```jsonc
  {
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Wrangler",
        "type": "node",
        "request": "attach",
        "port": 9229,
        // These can be omitted, but doing so causes silent errors in the runtime

  Previously, `console.log()` calls before the Workers runtime was ready to
  receive requests wouldn't be shown. This meant any logs in the global scope
  likely weren't visible. This change ensures startup logs are shown. In particular,
  this should [fix Remix's HMR](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/issues/7616),
  which relies on startup logs to know when the Worker is ready.

  new `--service`|`-s` flag which accepts an array of `BINDING_NAME=SCRIPT_NAME`
  where `BINDING_NAME` is the name of the binding and `SCRIPT_NAME` is the name
  of the worker (as defined in its `wrangler.toml`), such workers need to be
  running locally with with `wrangler dev`.

  For example if a user has a worker named `worker-a`, in order to locally bind
  to that they'll need to open two different terminals, in each navigate to the
  respective worker/pages application and then run respectively `wrangler dev` and
  `wrangler pages ./publicDir --service MY_SERVICE=worker-a` this will add the
  `MY_SERVICE` binding to pages' worker `env` object.

  Note: additionally after the `SCRIPT_NAME` the name of an environment can be specified,
  prefixed by an `@` (as in: `MY_SERVICE=SCRIPT_NAME@PRODUCTION`), this behavior is however
  experimental and not fully properly defined.

  When tailing a tail worker, messages previously had a null event property. Following https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/1248, these events have a valid event, specifying which scripts produced events that caused your tail worker to run.

  As part of rolling this out, we're filtering out tail events in the internal tail infrastructure, so we control when these new messages are forward to tail sessions, and can merge this freely.

  One idiosyncracy to note, however, is that tail workers always report an "OK" status, even if they run out of memory or throw. That is being tracked and worked on separately.

  For projects which are slow to upload - either because of client bandwidth or large numbers of files and sizes - It's possible for the JWT to expire multiple times. Since our network request concurrency is set to 3, it's possible that each time the JWT expires we get 3 failed attempts. This can quickly exhaust our upload attempt count and cause the entire process to bail.

  This change makes it such that jwt refreshes do not count as a failed upload attempt.

- [#3726](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3726) [`7d20bdbd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/7d20bdbd4ed7c5003b327a58af8d5c402df9fe2b) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - feat: support partial bundling with configurable external modules

  Setting `find_additional_modules` to `true` in your configuration file will now instruct Wrangler to look for files in
  your `base_dir` that match your configured `rules`, and deploy them as unbundled, external modules with your Worker.
  `base_dir` defaults to the directory containing your `main` entrypoint.

  Wrangler can operate in two modes: the default bundling mode and `--no-bundle` mode. In bundling mode, dynamic imports
  (e.g. `await import("./large-dep.mjs")`) would be bundled into your entrypoint, making lazy loading less effective.
  Additionally, variable dynamic imports (e.g. ``await import(`./lang/${language}.mjs`)``) would always fail at runtime,
  as Wrangler would have no way of knowing which modules to upload. The `--no-bundle` mode sought to address these issues
  by disabling Wrangler's bundling entirely, and just deploying code as is. Unfortunately, this also disabled Wrangler's
  code transformations (e.g. TypeScript compilation, `--assets`, `--test-scheduled`, etc).

  With this change, we now additionally support _partial bundling_. Files are bundled into a single Worker entry-point file
  unless `find_additional_modules` is `true`, and the file matches one of the configured `rules`. See
  https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/bundling/ for more details and examples.

  When using `find_additional_modules` (or `no_bundle`) we find files that
  will be uploaded to be deployed alongside the Worker.

  Previously, if an `outDir` was specified, only the Worker code was output
  to this directory. Now all additional modules are also output there too.

* [#4067](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4067) [`31270711`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/31270711fe3f48ff94138cf1626f44b8b052d698) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - fix: generate valid source maps with `wrangler pages dev` on macOS

  On macOS, `wrangler pages dev` previously generated source maps with an
  incorrect number of `../`s in relative paths. This change ensures paths are
  always correct, improving support for breakpoint debugging.

  `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST` can now be imported in subdirectories when
  `--no-bundle` or `find_additional_modules` are enabled.

* [#4066](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4066) [`c8b4a07f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/c8b4a07f2e799df44da70cb1eaeb2a7480e0af7a) Thanks [@RamIdeas](https://github.com/RamIdeas)! - fix: we no longer infer pathnames from route patterns as the host

  During local development, inside your worker, the host of `request.url` is inferred from the `routes` in your config.

  Previously, route patterns like "\*/some/path/name" would infer the host as "some". We now handle this case and determine we cannot infer a host from such patterns.

### Patch Changes

- [#4041](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4041) [`6b1c327d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/6b1c327d00befb6d95a88f4451547457b1927dd4) Thanks [@elithrar](https://github.com/elithrar)! - Fixed a bug in Vectorize that send preset configurations with the wrong key. This was patched on the server-side to work around this for users in the meantime.

* [#4054](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4054) [`f8c52b93`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/f8c52b938dd6a7ccf25fa54bd73e8f6206808ad4) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - fix: allow `wrangler pages dev` sessions to be reloaded

  Previously, `wrangler pages dev` attempted to send messages on a closed IPC
  channel when sources changed, resulting in an `ERR_IPC_CHANNEL_CLOSED` error.
  This change ensures the channel stays open until the user exits `wrangler pages dev`.

  Example `wrangler.toml`

      name = "ai-worker"
      main = "src/index.ts"

      [ai]
      binding = "AI"

  Example script:

  Previously, breakpoint debugging using Wrangler's DevTools was only supported
  in local mode, when using Wrangler's built-in bundler. This change extends that
  to remote development, and `--no-bundle`.

  When using `--remote` and `--no-bundle` together, uncaught errors will now be
  source-mapped when logged too.

* [#3951](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3951) [`e0850ad1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/e0850ad1ebfbb775a78339136e3a2c571d80e566) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - feat: add support for Visual Studio Code's built-in breakpoint debugger

  Wrangler now supports breakpoint debugging with Visual Studio Code's debugger.
  Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following contents...

  ```json
  {
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Wrangler",
        "type": "node",
        "request": "attach",
        "port": 9229,
        "cwd": "/",
        "resolveSourceMapLocations": null,
        "attachExistingChildren": false,
        "autoAttachChildProcesses": false
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ...then run `wrangler dev`, and launch the configuration.

  Most bundlers, and other tooling that give you size outputs will colorize their the text to indicate if the value is within certain ranges.
  The current range values are:
  red 100% - 90%
  yellow 89% - 70%

### Minor Changes

- [#3775](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3775) [`3af30879`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/3af3087954e2d1580c3c3b6ac9d63c0737f4ba2a) Thanks [@bthwaites](https://github.com/bthwaites)! - R2 Jurisdictional Restrictions guarantee objects in a bucket are stored within a specific jurisdiction. Wrangler now allows you to interact with buckets in a defined jurisdiction.

  Wrangler R2 operations now support a `-J` flag that allows the user to specify a jurisdiction. When passing the `-J` flag, you will only be able to interact with R2 resources within that jurisdiction.

  ```bash
  # List all of the buckets in the EU jurisdiction
  wrangler r2 bucket list -J eu
  # Downloads the object 'myfile.txt' from the bucket 'mybucket' in EU jurisdiction
  wrangler r2 object get mybucket/myfile.txt -J eu
  ```

  To access R2 buckets that belong to a jurisdiction from Workers, you will need to specify the jurisdiction as well as the bucket name as part of your bindings in your `wrangler.toml`:

  ```toml
  [[r2_buckets]]
  bindings = [
    { binding = "MY_BUCKET", bucket_name = "<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>", jurisdiction = "<JURISDICTION>" }
  ]
  ```

  Previously `secret"bulk` would only log an error on failure of any of the upload requests.
  Now when 'secret:bulk' has an upload request fail it throws an Error which sends an `process.exit(1)` at the root `.catch()` signal.
  This will enable error handling in programmatic uses of `secret:bulk`.

- [#3384](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3384) [`ccc19d57`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/ccc19d57e0b6a557c39bedbbb92ec4e52c580975) Thanks [@Peter-Sparksuite](https://github.com/Peter-Sparksuite)! - feature: add wrangler deploy option: --old-asset-ttl [seconds]

  `wrangler deploy` immediately deletes assets that are no longer current, which has a side-effect for existing progressive web app users of seeing 404 errors as the app tries to access assets that no longer exist.

  This new feature:

  - does not change the default behavior of immediately deleting no-longer needed assets.
  - allows users to opt-in to expiring newly obsoleted assets after the provided number of seconds hence, so that current users will have a time buffer before seeing 404 errors.
  - is similar in concept to what was introduced in Wrangler 1.x with https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/2221.
  - is careful to avoid extension of existing expiration targets on already expiring old assets, which may have contributed to unexpectedly large KV storage accumulations (perhaps why, in Wrangler 1.x, the reversion https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/2228 happened).
  - no breaking changes for users relying on the default behavior, but some output changes exist when the new option is used, to indicate the change in behavior.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3583](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3583) [`78ddb8de`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/78ddb8de78152b2cb4180f23b51ee5478637d92d) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - Upgrade Miniflare (and hence `workerd`) to `v3.20230710.0`.

* [#3426](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3426) [`5a74cb55`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/5a74cb559611b1035fe97ebbe870d7061f3b41d0) Thanks [@matthewdavidrodgers](https://github.com/matthewdavidrodgers)! - Prefer non-force deletes unless a Worker is a dependency of another.

  If a Worker is used as a service binding, a durable object namespace, an outbounds for a dynamic dispatch namespace, or a tail consumer, then deleting that Worker will break those existing ones that depend upon it. Deleting with ?force=true allows you to delete anyway, which is currently the default in Wrangler.

  Force deletes are not often necessary, however, and using it as the default has unfortunate consequences in the API. To avoid them, we check if any of those conditions exist, and present the information to the user. If they explicitly acknowledge they're ok with breaking their other Workers, fine, we let them do it. Otherwise, we'll always use the much safer non-force deletes. We also add a "--force" flag to the delete command to skip the checks and confirmation and proceed with ?force=true

  Ensure middleware is only registered on the first request when using module workers.
  This should prevent stack overflows and slowdowns when making large number of requests to `wrangler dev` with infrequent reloads.

  This ensures consistency with other messaging, documentation and our dashboard,
  which all refer to deployments. This also avoids confusion with the similar but
  very different `npm publish` command. `wrangler publish` will remain a
  deprecated alias for now, but will be removed in the next major version of Wrangler.

  `wrangler dev` now runs fully-locally by default, using the open-source Cloudflare Workers runtime [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd).
  To restore the previous behaviour of running on a remote machine with access to production data, use the new `--remote` flag.
  The `--local` and `--experimental-local` flags have been deprecated, as this behaviour is now the default, and will be removed in the next major version.

  Wrangler will now persist local KV, R2, D1, Cache and Durable Object data
  in the `.wrangler` folder, by default, between reloads. This persistence
  directory can be customised with the `--persist-to` flag. The `--persist` flag
  has been removed, as this is now the default behaviour.

  Previously, if Wrangler was installed globally _and_ locally within a project,
  running the global Wrangler would instead invoke the local version.
  This behaviour was contrary to most other JavaScript CLI tools and has now been
  removed. We recommend you use `npx wrangler` instead, which will invoke the
  local version if installed, or install globally if not.

  With this PR, users will be able to run `wrangler d1 create <NAME> --experimental-backend` to create new D1 dbs that use an experimental backend. You can also run `wrangler d1 migrations apply <NAME> experimental-backend` to run migrations against an experimental database.

  On top of that, both `wrangler d1 migrations apply <NAME>` and `wrangler d1 execute <NAME>` now have a configurable `batch-size` flag, as the experimental backend can handle more than 10000 statements at a time.

### Minor Changes

- [#2769](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2769) [`0a779904`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/0a77990457652af36c60c52bf9c38c3a69945de4) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - feature: Support modules with `--no-bundle`

  When the `--no-bundle` flag is set, Wrangler now has support for uploading additional modules alongside the entrypoint. This will allow modules to be imported at runtime on Cloudflare's Edge. This respects Wrangler's [module rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bundling) configuration, which means that only imports of non-JS modules will trigger an upload by default. For instance, the following code will now work with `--no-bundle` (assuming the `example.wasm` file exists at the correct path):

  ```js
  // index.js
  import wasm from './example.wasm'

  export default {
    async fetch() {
      await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm, ...)
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  For JS modules, it's necessary to specify an additional [module rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bundling) (or rules) in your `wrangler.toml` to configure your modules as ES modules or Common JS modules. For instance, to upload additional JavaScript files as ES modules, add the following module rule to your `wrangler.toml`, which tells Wrangler that all `**/*.js` files are ES modules.

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "ESModule", globs = ["**/*.js"]},
  ]
  ```

  If you have Common JS modules, you'd configure Wrangler with a CommonJS rule (the following rule tells Wrangler that all `.cjs` files are Common JS modules):

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "CommonJS", globs = ["**/*.cjs"]},
  ]
  ```

  In most projects, adding a single rule will be sufficient. However, for advanced usecases where you're mixing ES modules and Common JS modules, you'll need to use multiple rule definitions. For instance, the following set of rules will match all `.mjs` files as ES modules, all `.cjs` files as Common JS modules, and the `nested/say-hello.js` file as Common JS.

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "CommonJS", globs = ["nested/say-hello.js", "**/*.cjs"]},
    { type = "ESModule", globs = ["**/*.mjs"]}
  ]
  ```

  If multiple rules overlap, Wrangler will log a warning about the duplicate rules, and will discard additional rules that matches a module. For example, the following rule configuration classifies `dep.js` as both a Common JS module and an ES module:

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "CommonJS", globs = ["dep.js"]},
    { type = "ESModule", globs = ["dep.js"]}
  ]
  ```

  Wrangler will treat `dep.js` as a Common JS module, since that was the first rule that matched, and will log the following warning:

  ```
  ▲ [WARNING] Ignoring duplicate module: dep.js (esm)
  ```

  This also adds a new configuration option to `wrangler.toml`: `base_dir`. Defaulting to the directory of your Worker's main entrypoint, this tells Wrangler where your additional modules are located, and determines the module paths against which your module rule globs are matched.

  For instance, given the following directory structure:

  ```
  - wrangler.toml
  - src/
    - index.html
    - vendor/
      - dependency.js
    - js/
      - index.js
  ```

  If your `wrangler.toml` had `main = "src/js/index.js"`, you would need to set `base_dir = "src"` in order to be able to import `src/vendor/dependency.js` and `src/index.html` from `src/js/index.js`.

  Previously, querystring params would be stripped, causing issues for test cases that depended on them. For example, given the following worker script:

  ```js
  export default {
    fetch(req) {
      const url = new URL(req.url);
      const name = url.searchParams.get("name");
      return new Response("Hello, " + name);
    },
  };
  ```

  would fail the following test case:

  ```js
  const worker = await unstable_dev("script.js");
  const res = await worker.fetch("http://worker?name=Walshy");
  const text = await res.text();
  expect(text).toBe("Hello, Walshy");
  ```

  Previously, levels set via the `WRANGLER_LOG` environment-variable were case-sensitive.
  If an unexpected level was set, Wrangler would fallback to `none`, hiding all logs.
  The fallback has now been switched to `log`, and lenient case-insensitive matching is used when setting the level.

`wrangler deployments view [deployment-id]` will get the details of a deployment, including bindings and usage model information.
This information can be used to help debug bad deployments.

`wrangler rollback [deployment-id]` will rollback to a specific deployment in the runtime. This will be useful in situations like recovering from a bad
deployment quickly while resolving issues. If a deployment id is not specified wrangler will rollback to the previous deployment. This rollback only changes the code in the runtime and doesn't affect any code or configurations
in a developer's local setup.

`wrangler deployments list` will list the 10 most recent deployments. This command originally existed as `wrangler deployments`

  We now enable bundling by default for a `functions/` folder and for an `_worker.js` in Pages Functions. This allows you to use external modules such as Wasm. You can disable this behavior in Direct Upload projects by using the `--no-bundle` argument in `wrangler pages publish` and `wrangler pages dev`.

- [#2766](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2766) [`7912e63a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/7912e63aa15affc6e3d4a8cfe5dd54348c6e79ba) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - fix: correctly detect `service-worker` format when using `typeof module`

  Wrangler automatically detects whether your code is a `modules` or `service-worker` format Worker based on the presence of a `default` `export`. This check currently works by building your entrypoint with `esbuild` and looking at the output metafile.

  Previously, we were passing `format: "esm"` to `esbuild` when performing this check, which enables _format conversion_. This may introduce `export default` into the built code, even if it wasn't there to start with, resulting in incorrect format detections.

  This change removes `format: "esm"` which disables format conversion when bundling is disabled. See https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format for more details.

  Undici changed how they referenced `FormData`, which meant that when used in our bundle process, we were failing to upload `multipart/form-data` bodies. This affected `wrangler pages publish` and `wrangler publish`.

- [#2720](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2720) [`de0cb57a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/de0cb57a7a537e6a8554621451b3fd76ffb2e1d1) Thanks [@JacobMGEvans](https://github.com/JacobMGEvans)! - Fix: Upgraded to ES2022 for improved compatibility
  Upgraded worker code target version from ES2020 to ES2022 for better compatibility and unblocking of a workaround related to [issue #2029](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/2029). The worker runtime now uses the same V8 version as recent Chrome and is 99% ES2016+ compliant. The only thing we don't support on the Workers runtime, the remaining 1%, is the ES2022 RegEx feature as seen in the compat table for the latest Chrome version.

  Functionality implemented first as an api, which is used in the cli standard
  api commands

  Note that this adds a new OAuth scope, so OAuth users will need to log out and
  log back in to use the new 'mtls-certificate' commands
  However, publishing with mtls-certifcate bindings (bindings of type
  'mtls_certificate') will work without the scope.

* [#2717](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2717) [`c5943c9f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/c5943c9fe54e8bcf9ee1bf8ca992d2f8b84360a1) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - Upgrade `miniflare` to [`2.12.0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/releases/tag/v2.12.0), including support for R2 multipart upload bindings, the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag, D1 fixes and more!

  Currently it is not possible to import `wasm` modules in either Pages
  Functions or Pages Advanced Mode projects.

  This commit caries out work to address the aforementioned issue by
  enabling `wasm` module imports in `wrangler pages publish`. As a result,
  Pages users can now import their `wasm` modules withing their Functions
  or `_worker.js` files, and `wrangler pages publish` will correctly
  bundle everything and serve these "external" modules.

  This change specifically enables `wasm` module imports in `wrangler pages functions build`.
  As a result, Pages users can now import their `wasm` modules within their Functions or
  `_worker.js` files, and `wrangler pages functions build` will correctly bundle everything
  and output the expected result file.

  This can be used to build isomorphic libraries that have different implementations depending on the JavaScript runtime they're running in.
  When bundling, Wrangler will try to load the [`workerd` key](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/#workerd).
  This is the [standard key](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/#workerd) for the Cloudflare Workers runtime.

  This PR makes it possible to access D1 from Durable Objects.

  To be able to query D1 from your Durable Object, you'll need to install the latest version of wrangler, and redeploy your Worker.

  For a D1 binding like:

  ```toml
  [[d1_databases]]
  binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
  database_name = "my-database-name"
  database_id = "UUID-GOES-HERE"
  preview_database_id = "UUID-GOES-HERE"
  ```

  You'll be able to access your D1 database via `env.DB` in your Durable Object.

  Currently it is not possible to import `wasm` modules in either Pages
  Functions or Pages Advanced Mode projects.

  This commit caries out work to address the aforementioned issue by
  enabling `wasm` module imports in `wrangler pages dev`. As a result,
  Pages users can now import their `wasm` modules withing their Functions
  or `_worker.js` files, and `wrangler pages dev` will correctly bundle
  everything and serve these "external" modules.

  ```
  import hello from "./hello.wasm"

  export async function onRequest() {
  	const module = await WebAssembly.instantiate(hello);
  	return new Response(module.exports.hello);
  }
  ```

  When we bundle a Worker `esbuild` takes care of writing the
  results to the output directory. However, if the Worker contains
  any `external` imports, such as text/wasm/binary module imports,
  that cannot be inlined into the same bundle file, `bundleWorker`
  will not copy these files to the output directory. This doesn't
  affect `wrangler publish` per se, because of how the Worker
  upload FormData is created. It does however create some
  inconsistencies when running `wrangler publish --outdir` or
  `wrangler publish --outdir --dry-run`, in that, `outdir` will
  not contain those external import files.

  This commit addresses this issue by making sure the aforementioned
  files do get copied over to `outdir` together with `esbuild`'s
  resulting bundle files.

- [#2538](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2538) [`af4f27c5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/af4f27c5966f52e605ab7c16ff9746b7802d3479) Thanks [@edevil](https://github.com/edevil)! - feat: support EmailEvent event type in `wrangler tail`.

* [#2404](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2404) [`3f824347`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/3f824347c624a2cedf4af2b6bbd781b8581b08b5) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - feat: support bundling the raw Pages `_worker.js` before deploying

  Previously, if you provided a `_worker.js` file, then Pages would simply check the
  file for disallowed imports and then deploy the file as-is.

  Not bundling the `_worker.js` file means that it cannot containing imports to other
  JS files, but also prevents Wrangler from adding shims such as the one for the D1 alpha
  release.

  This change adds the ability to tell Wrangler to pass the `_worker.js` through the
  normal Wrangler bundling process before deploying by setting the `--bundle`
  command line argument to `wrangler pages dev` and `wrangler pages publish`.

  This is in keeping with the same flag for `wrangler publish`.

  Currently bundling is opt-in, flag defaults to `false` if not provided.

  This will update all the necessary OAuth and API URLs, update the OAuth client ID, and
  also (if necessary) acquire an Access token for to get through the firewall to the

  Publishing Pages projects containing a functions directory incorrectly did not upload the filepath-routing config so that the user can view it in Dash. This fixes that, making the generated routes viewable under `Routing configuration` in the `Functions` tab of a deployment.

## 2.1.15

### Patch Changes

- [#2103](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2103) [`f1fd62a1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/f1fd62a11642de45eb87ebacb044fe8fcf2beea2) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - fix: Don't upload `functions/` directory as part of `wrangler pages publish`

  If the root directory of a project was the same as the build output directory, we were previously uploading the `functions/` directory as static assets. This PR now ensures that the `functions/` files are only used to create Pages Functions and are no longer uploaded as static assets.

  Additionally, we also now _do_ upload `_worker.js`, `_headers`, `_redirects` and `_routes.json` if they aren't immediate children of the build output directory. Previously, we'd ignore all files with this name regardless of location. For example, if you have a `public/blog/how-to-use-pages/_headers` file (where `public` is your build output directory), we will now upload the `_headers` file as a static asset.

* [#2111](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2111) [`ab52f771`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/ab52f7717ffd5411886d1e30aee98f821237ddad) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - feat: Add a `passThroughOnException()` handler in Pages Functions

  This `passThroughOnException()` handler is not as good as the built-in for Workers. We're just adding it now as a stop-gap until we can do the behind-the-scenes plumbing required to make the built-in function work properly.

  We wrap your Pages Functions code in a `try/catch` and on failure, if you call `passThroughOnException()` we defer to the static assets of your project.

  For example:

  ```ts
  export const onRequest = ({ passThroughOnException }) => {
    passThroughOnException();

    x; // Would ordinarily throw an error, but instead, static assets are served.
  };
  ```

  Custom module rules generate `declare module`s based on the module type (`Text`, `Data` or `CompiledWasm`).
  Module Example Outputs:

  Currently, the logic by which we transform routing rules in `_routes.json` to
  regular expressions, so we can perform `pathname` matching & routing when we
  run `wrangler pages dev`, is too permissive, and leads to serving incorrect
  assets for certain url paths.

  For example, a routing rule such as `/foo` will incorrectly match pathname
  `/bar/foo`. Similarly, pathname `/foo` will be incorrectly matched by the
  `/` routing rule.
  This commit fixes our routing rule to pathname matching logic and brings
  `wrangler pages dev` on par with routing in deployed Pages projects.

  This patch deletes any site/asset kv namespaces associated with a worker when `wrangler delete` is used.

* [#2013](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2013) [`c63ca0a5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/c63ca0a550a4c3801665161d6d6ce5d2d3bff0a5) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: make d1 help print if a command is incomplete

  Prior to this change, d1's commands would return silently if wrangler wasn't supplied enough arguments to run the command.

  This change resolves this issue, and ensures help is always printed if the command couldn't run.

  Previously, when a user wanted to publish a worker to https://workers.dev by setting `workers_dev = true` in their `wrangler.toml`,
  but their account didn't have a subdomain registered, we would error out.

  Now, we offer to create one for them. It's not implemented for `wrangler dev`, which also expects you to have registered a
  workers.dev subdomain, but we now error correctly and tell them what the problem is.

  Prior to this change, passing --define someKey:https://some-value.com would result in an incomplete value being passed to the Worker.

  This change correctly handles colons for var and define in `wrangler dev` and `wrangler publish`.

* [#2032](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2032) [`f33805d2`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/f33805d28b23b613f03169726b91ac3b1b3428d5) Thanks [@caass](https://github.com/caass)! - Catch unsupported terminal errors and provide a nicer error message.

  Wrangler depends on terminals supporting [raw mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_mode). Previously, attempting to run wrangler from a terminal that didn't support raw mode would result in
  an Ink error, which was both an exposure of an internal implementation detail to the user and also not actionable:

  ```text
    ERROR Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin, which Ink uses
         as input stream by default.
         Read about how to prevent this error on
         https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/#israwmodesupported
  ```

  Now, we provide a much nicer error, which provides an easy next step for th user:

  ```text

  ERROR: This terminal doesn't support raw mode.

  Wrangler uses raw mode to read user input and write output to the terminal, and won't function correctly without it.

  Try running your previous command in a terminal that supports raw mode, such as Command Prompt or Powershell.
  ```

  Previously, `wrangler generate` was a thin wrapper around [`create-cloudflare`](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare). Now, we've moved over the logic from that package directly into `wrangler`.

  When using a `_worker.js` file, the entire `/functions` directory should be ignored – this includes its routing and middleware characteristics. Currently `wrangler pages dev` does the reverse, by prioritizing
  `/functions` over `_worker.js`. These changes fix the current behaviour.

  While in beta, you cannot use D1 bindings without bundling your worker as these are added in through a facade which gets bypassed when using the `no-bundle` option.

  With this change, `unstable_dev` can now perform end-to-end (e2e) tests against your workers as you dev.

  Note that to use this feature in CI, you'll need to configure `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` as an environment variable in your CI, and potentially add `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` as an environment variable in your CI, or `account_id` in your `wrangler.toml`.

  Usage:

  ```js
  await unstable_dev("src/index.ts", {
    local: false,
  });
  ```

  Just like in the typescript templates, and the javascript template for scheduled workers, we include `env` and `ctx` as parameters to the `fetch` export. This makes it clearer where environment variables live.

  After this change, when printing the bindings it has access to, wrangler will correctly only add quotes around string variables, and serialize objects via JSON.stringify (rather than printing `"[object Object]"`).

- [#1953](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1953) [`20195479`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/20195479c9f57d9fede1f5924f6a4ab36f860bea) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - Add `--experimental-local` support to `unstable_dev`

  We change how websockets are handled in the proxy server, fixing multiple issues of websocket behaviour, particularly to do with headers.

  In particular this fixes:

  - the protocol passed between the client and the worker was being stripped out by wrangler
  - wrangler was discarding additional headesr from websocket upgrade response
  - websocket close code and reason was not being propagated by wrangler

  when using `unstable_dev()`, I think we want to expose the port/address that the server has started on. The usecase is when trying to connect to the server _without_ calling `.fetch()` (example: when making a websocket connection).

- [#1911](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1911) [`16c28502`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/16c28502593c27a1b372d8056a55cdee32b5c4cf) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - fix: put config cache log behind logger.debug

  Prior to this change, wrangler would print `Retrieving cached values for...` after almost every single command.

  After this change, you'll only see this message if you add `WRANGLER_LOG=debug` before your command.

  By default, wrangler.toml is the source of truth for your environment configuration, like a terraform file.

  If you change your settings (particularly your vars) in the dashboard, wrangler _will_ override them. If you want to disable this behavior, set this field to true.

  Between wrangler 2.0.28 and 2.1.5, by default wrangler would _not_ delete your vars by default, breaking expected wrangler.toml behaviour.

  Using the new middleware (https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1735), we implement a way of testing scheduled workers from a fetch using `wrangler dev` in remote mode, by passing a new command line flag `--test-scheduled`. This exposes a route `/__scheduled` which will trigger the scheduled event.

  ```sh
  $ npx wrangler dev index.js --test-scheduled

  $ curl http://localhost:8787/__scheduled

  This change introduces the ability to test multi-worker setups via the wrangler API's [unstable_dev](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#unstable_dev) function.

  Usage:

  Prior to this change, `wrangler.unstable_dev()` would only support running one instance of wrangler at a time, as Ink only lets you render one instance of React. This resulted in test failures in CI.

  This change creates pure JS/TS versions of these React hooks:

  - useEsbuild
  - useLocalWorker
  - useCustomBuild
  - useTmpDir

  As a side-effect of removing React, tests should run faster in CI.

  The Worker-for-Platforms team would like to rename this field to more closely match what it's called internally. This fix does a search+replace on this term. This feature already had an experimental warning, and no one's using it at the moment, so we're not going to add a warning/backward compat for existing customers.

  Currently, when we publish a worker, we delete an pre-existing bindings if they're not otherwise defined in `wrangler.toml`, and overwrite existing ones. But folks may be deploying with wrangler, and changing environment variables on the fly (like marketing messages, etc). It's annoying when deploying via wrangler blows away those values.

  This patch fixes one of those issues. It will not delete any older bindings that are not in wrangler.toml. It still _does_ overwrite existing vars, but at least this gives a way for developers to have some vars that are not blown away on every publish.

  Because we'd used a default for 0.0.0.0 for the `--ip` flag, `wrangler dev` was overriding the value specified in `wrangler.toml` under `dev.ip`. This fix removes the default value (since it's being set when normalising config anyway).

* [#1730](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1730) [`27ad80ee`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/27ad80eed7f25393a0e5c1d8a62c3b0e743a639d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: `--var name:value` and `--define name:value`

  This enables passing values for `[vars]` and `[define]` via the cli. We have a number of usecases where the values to be injected during dev/publish aren't available statically (eg: a version string, some identifier for 3p libraries, etc) and reading those values only from `wrangler.toml` isn't good ergonomically. So we can now read those values when passed through the CLI.

  Example: add a var during dev: `wrangler dev --var xyz:123` will inject the var `xyz` with string `"123"`

  (note, only strings allowed for `--var`)

  substitute a global value: `wrangler dev --define XYZ:123` will replace every global identifier `XYZ` with the value `123`.

  The same flags also work with `wrangler publish`.

  Also, you can use actual environment vars in these commands. e.g.: `wrangler dev --var xyz:$XYZ` will set `xyz` to whatever `XYZ` has been set to in the terminal environment.

  Building on [the recent work for multi-worker Service bindings in local dev](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1503), this now adds support for direct Durable Object namespace bindings.

  A parent (calling) Worker will look for child Workers (where the Durable Object has been defined) by matching the `script_name` configuration option with the child's Service name. For example, if you have a Worker A which defines a Durable Object, `MyDurableObject`, and Worker B which references A's Durable Object:

  ```toml
  name = "A"

  [durable_objects]
  bindings = [
  	{ name = "MY_DO", class_name = "MyDurableObject" }
  ]
  ```

  ```toml
  name = "B"

  [durable_objects]
  bindings = [
  	{ name = "REFERENCED_DO", class_name = "MyDurableObject", script_name = "A" }
  ]
  ```

  `MY_DO` will work as normal in Worker A. `REFERENCED_DO` in Worker B will point at A's Durable Object.

  Note: this only works in local mode (`wrangler dev --local`) at present.

  Often users experience issues due to tokens not having the correct permissions associated with them (often due to new scopes being created for new products).

We cannot access the permissions on an API key, so we direct the user to the location in the dashboard to achieve this.
  We also cache the scopes of OAuth tokens alongside the access and refresh tokens in the .wrangler/config file to achieve this.

  Preamble: Typically, a Worker has been the _unit_ of a javascript project on our platform. Any logic that you need, you fit into one worker, ~ 1MB of javascript and bindings. If you wanted to deploy a larger application, you could define different workers on different routes. This is fine for microservice style architectures, but not all projects can be cleaved along the route boundaries; you lose out on sharing code and resources, and can still cross the size limit with heavy dependencies.

  Service bindings provide a novel mechanism for composing multiple workers into a unified architecture. You could deploy shared code into a worker, and make requests to it from another worker. This lets you architect your code along functional boundaries, while also providing some relief to the 1MB size limit.

  I propose a model for developing multiple bound workers in a single project.

  Consider Worker A, at `workers/a.js`, with a `wrangler.toml` like so:

  ```toml
  name = 'A'

  [[services]]
  binding = 'Bee'
  service = 'B'
  ```

  and content like so:

  ```js
  export default {
    fetch(req, env) {
      return env.Bee.fetch(req);
    },
  };
  ```

  Consider Worker B, at `workers/b.js`, with a `wrangler.toml` like so:

  ```toml
  name = 'B'
  ```

  and content like so:

  ```js
  export default {
    fetch(req, env) {
      return new Response("Hello World");
    },
  };
  ```

  So, a worker A, bound to B, that simply passes on the request to B.

  ## Local mode:

  Currently, when I run `wrangler dev --local` on A (or switch from remote to local mode during a dev session), and make requests to A, they'll fail because the bindings don't exist in local mode.

  What I'd like, is to be able to run `wrangler dev --local` on B as well, and have my dev instance of A make requests to the dev instance of B. When I'm happy with my changes, I'd simply deploy both workers (again, ideally as a batched publish).

  ## Proposal: A local dev registry for workers.

  - Running `wrangler dev` on a machine should start up a local service registry (if there isn't one loaded already) as a server on a well known port.
  - Further, it should then "register" itself with the registry with metadata about itself; whether it's running in remote/local mode, the port and ip its dev server is listening on, and any additional configuration (eg: in remote mode, a couple of extra headers have to be added to every request made to the dev session, so we'd add that data into the registry as well.)
  - Every worker that has service bindings configured, should intercept requests to said binding, and instead make a request to the locally running instance of the service. It could rewrite these requests as it pleases.

  (In future PRs, we'll introduce a system for doing the same with remote mode dev, as well as mixed mode. )

  This adds an internal mechanism for applying multiple "middleware"/facades on to workers. This lets us add functionality during dev and/or publish, where we can modify requests or env, or other ideas. (See https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1466 for actual usecases)

  As part of this, I implemented a simple facade that formats errors in dev. To enable it you need to set an environment variable `FORMAT_WRANGLER_ERRORS=true`. This _isn't_ a new feature we're shipping with wrangler, it's simply to demonstrate how to write middleware. We'll probably remove it in the future.

  Couple things cleaned up here:

  Originally the usage of the /domains api (for publishing to custom domains) was a bit clumsy: we would attempt to optimistically publish, but the api would eagerly fail with specific error codes on why it occurred. This made for some weird control flow for retries with override flags, as well as fragile extraction of error messages.

  Now we use the new /domains/changeset api to generate a changeset of actions required to get to a new state of custom domains, which informs us up front of which domains would need to be updated and overridden, and we can pass flags as needed. I do make an extra hop back to the api to lookup what the custom domains requiring updates are already attached to, but given how helpful I imagine that to be, I'm for it.

  I also updated the api used for publishing the domains, from /domains to /domains/records. The latter was added to allow us to add flexibility for things like the /domains/changeset resource, and thus the former is being deprecated

  In dev, we inject a patch for `fetch()` to detect bad usages.

  When using an api token, sometimes the call to get a user's membership details fails with a 9109 error.

  We replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in workers with the value of the environment variable. However, we have a bug where when we make an actual build of wrangler (which has NODE_ENV set as "production"), we were also replacing the expression where we'd replace it in a worker. The result was that all workers would have `process.env.NODE_ENV` set to production, no matter what the user had set. The fix here is to use a "dynamic" value for the expression so that our build system doesn't replace it.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/992, we added a dev-only helper that would warn when using `fetch()` in a manner that wouldn't work as expected (because of a bug we currently have in the runtime). We did this by injecting a file that would override usages of `fetch()`. When using pnp style package managers like yarn, this file can't be resolved correctly. So to fix that, we extract it into the temporary destination directory that we use to build the worker (much like a similar fix we did in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1154)

  This change adds support in Wrangler for sending usage metrics to Cloudflare.
  This is an opt-in only feature. We will ask the user for permission only once per device.
  The user must grant permission, on a per device basis, before we send usage metrics to Cloudflare.
  The permission can also be overridden on a per project basis by setting `send_metrics = false` in the `wrangler.toml`.
  If Wrangler is running in non-interactive mode (such as in a CI job) and the user has not already given permission
  we will assume that we cannot send usage metrics.

  The aim of this feature is to help us learn what and how features of Wrangler (and also the Cloudflare dashboard)
  are being used in order to improve the developer experience.

## 2.0.16

### Patch Changes

- [#992](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/992) [`ee6b413`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/ee6b4138121b200c86566b61fdb01495cb05947b) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - fix: add warning to `fetch()` calls that will change the requested port

  In Workers published to the Edge (rather than previews) there is a bug where a custom port on a downstream fetch request is ignored, defaulting to the standard port.
  For example, `https://my.example.com:668` will actually send the request to `https://my.example.com:443`.

  This does not happen when using `wrangler dev` (both in remote and local mode), but to ensure that developers are aware of it this change displays a runtime warning in the console when the bug is hit.

  Closes #1320

* [#1378](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1378) [`2579257`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/25792574c4197257203ba0a11e7129b2b94cec17) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - chore: fully deprecate the `preview` command

  Before, we would warn folks that `preview` was deprecated in favour of `dev`, but then ran `dev` on their behalf.
  To avoid maintaining effectively two versions of the `dev` command, we're now just telling folks to run `dev`.

  We can pass routes when creating a `dev` session. The effect of this is when you visit a path that _doesn't_ match the given routes, then it instead does a fetch from the deployed worker on that path (if any). We were previously passing `*/*`, i.e, matching _all_ routes in dev; this fix now passes configured routes instead.

  As a configuration parallel to `--no-bundle` (introduced in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1300 as `--no-build`, renamed in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1399 to `--no-bundle`), this introduces a configuration field `no_bundle` to prevent bundling of the worker before it's published. It's inheritable, which means it can be defined inside environments as well.

  If the terminal isn't a TTY, fallback to non-interactive mode instead of throwing an error. This makes it so users of Bash on Windows can pipe to wrangler without an error being thrown.

  Prior to this PR, users of `unstable_dev` had to provide their own fetcher, and guess the address and port that the wrangler dev server was using.

  With this implementation, it's now possible to test wrangler, using just wrangler (and a test framework):

  ```js
  describe("worker", async () => {
    const worker = await wrangler.unstable_dev("src/index.ts");

    const resp = await worker.fetch();

    expect(resp).not.toBe(undefined);
    if (resp) {
      const text = await resp.text();
      expect(text).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`"Hello World!"`);
    }

    worker.stop();
  }
  ```

  This fix renames the `--no-build` cli arg to `--no-bundle`. `no-build` wasn't a great name because it would imply that we don't run custom builds specified under `[build]` which isn't true. So we rename closer to what wrangler actually does, which is bundling the input. This also makes it clearer that it's a single file upload.

* [#1278](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1278) [`8201733`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/820173330031acda5d2cd5c1b7bca58209a6ddff) Thanks [@Maximo-Guk](https://github.com/Maximo-Guk)! - Throw error if user attempts to use config with pages

  Prior to this change, logging with console.error/console.warn in a Worker wouldn't output anything to the console when running in local mode. This was happening because stderr data event handler was being removed after the `Debugger listening...` string was found.

  This change updates the stderr data event handler to forward on all events to `process.stderr`.

  Closes #1324

* [#1309](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1309) [`e5a6aca`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/e5a6aca696108cda8c3890b8ce2ec44c6cc09a0e) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - style: convert all source code indentation to tabs

  Fixes #1298

- [#1395](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1395) [`88f2702`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/88f270223be22c74b6374f6eefdf8e9fbf798e4d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: cache account id selection

  This adds caching for account id fetch/selection for all wrangler commands.

  Currently, if we have an api/oauth token, but haven't provided an account id, we fetch account information from cloudflare. If a user has just one account id, we automatically choose that. If there are more than one, then we show a dropdown and ask the user to pick one. This is convenient, and lets the user not have to specify their account id when starting a project.

  However, if does make startup slow, since it has to do that fetch every time. It's also annoying for folks with multiple account ids because they have to pick their account id every time.

  So we now cache the account details into `node_modules/.cache/wrangler` (much like pages already does with account id and project name).

  This patch also refactors `config-cache.ts`; it only caches if there's a `node_modules` folder, and it looks for the closest node_modules folder (and not directly in cwd). I also added tests for when a `node_modules` folder isn't available. It also trims the message that we log to terminal.

  Closes https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/300

* [#1391](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1391) [`ea7ee45`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/ea7ee452470a6a3f16768ab5de226c87d1ff2c0c) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: create a single session during remote dev

  Previously, we would be creating a fresh session for every script change during remote dev. While this _worked_, it makes iterating slower, and unnecessarily discards state. This fix makes it so we create only a single session for remote dev, and reuses that session on every script change. This also means we can use a single script id for every worker in a session (when a name isn't already given). Further, we also make the prewarming call of the preview space be non-blocking.

  Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1191

- [#1365](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1365) [`b9f7200`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/b9f7200afdfd2dbfed277fbb3c29ddbdaaa969da) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: normalise `account_id = ''` to `account_id: undefined`

  In older templates, (i.e made for Wrangler v1.x), `account_id =''` is considered as a valid input, but then ignored. With Wrangler 2, when running wrangler dev, we log an error, but it fixes itself after we get an account id. Much like https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1329, the fix here is to normalise that value when we see it, and replace it with `undefined` while logging a warning.

  This fix also tweaks the messaging for a blank route value to suggest some user action.

  This adds a `--no-build` flag to `wrangler publish`. We've had a bunch of people asking to be able to upload a worker directly, without any modifications. While there are tradeoffs to this approach (any linked modules etc won't work), we understand that people who need this functionality are aware of it (and the usecases that have presented themselves all seem to match this).

* [#1392](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1392) [`ff2e7cb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/ff2e7cbd5478b6b6ec65f5c507988ff860079337) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: keep site upload batches under 98 mb

  The maximum _request_ size for a batch upload is 100 MB. We were previously calculating the upload key value to be under _100 MiB_. Further, with a few bytes here and there, the size of the request can exceed 100 MiB. So this fix calculate using MB instead of MiB, but also brings down our own limit to 98 MB so there's some wiggle room for uploads.

  This feature les you bind a worker to a dynamic dispatch namespaces, which may have other workers bound inside it. (See https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-for-platforms/). Inside your `wrangler.toml`, you would add

  ```toml
  [[worker_namespaces]]
  binding = 'dispatcher' # available as env.dispatcher in your worker
  namespace = 'namespace-name' # the name of the namespace being bound
  ```

  This implements `config.define`. This lets the user define a map of keys to strings that will be substituted in the worker's source. This is particularly useful when combined with environments. A common usecase is for values that are sent along with metrics events; environment name, public keys, version numbers, etc. It's also sometimes a workaround for the usability of module env vars, which otherwise have to be threaded through request function stacks.

  As raised in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1254, it was discovered that binary uploads were being mangled by wrangler 2, whereas they worked in wrangler 1. This is because they were read into a string by providing an explicit encoding of `utf-8`. This fix reads provided files into a node `Buffer` that is then passed directly to the request.

  Subsequently https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1273 was raised in relation to a similar issue with gets from wrangler 2. This was happening due to the downloaded file being converted to `utf-8` encoding as it was pushed through `console.log`. By leveraging `process.stdout.write` we can push the fetched `ArrayBuffer` to std out directly without inferring any specific encoding value.

  If `git` does not support the `--initial-branch` argument then just fallback to the default initial branch name.

  We tried to be more clever about this but there are two many weird corner cases with different git versions on different architectures.
  Now we do our best, with recent versions of git, to ensure that the branch is called `main` but otherwise just make sure we don't crash.

  Users will frequently install `wrangler` globally to run commands like `wrangler init`, but we also recommend pinning a specific version of `wrangler` in a project's `package.json`. Now, when a user invokes a global install of `wrangler`, we'll check to see if they also have a local installation. If they do, we'll delegate to that version.

  Since we use a facade worker with `--assets`, an entry point is not strictly necessary. This makes a common usecase of "deploy a bunch of static assets" extremely easy to start, as a one liner `npx wrangler dev --assets path/to/folder` (and same with `publish`).

  When a user has multiple accounts we show a prompt to allow the user to select which they should use.
  This was broken in `wrangler dev` as we were trying to start a new ink.js app (to show the prompt)
  from inside a running ink.js app (the UI for `wrangler dev`).

  This fix refactors the `ChooseAccount` component so that it can be used directly within another component.

  When initializing a new project (via `wrangler init`) we attempt to reuse files in the current
  directory, or in an ancestor directory. In particular we look up the directory tree for
  package.json and tsconfig.json and use those instead of creating new ones.

  Now we only do this if you do not specify a name for the new Worker. If you do specify a name,
  we now only consider files in the directory where the Worker will be initialized.

  As raised in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1254, it was discovered that binary uploads were being mangled by Wrangler v2, whereas they worked in Wrangler v1. This is because they were read into a string by providing an explicit encoding of `utf-8`. This fix reads provided files into a node `Buffer` that is then passed directly to the request.

  When we upload a script bundle, we get the actual content of the script back in the response.

We can pass a queryparam `excludeScript` that, as it implies, exclude the script content in the response. This fix does that.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1241, we removed the vendored version of `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`, as well as the build configuration that would point to the vendored version when compiling a worker using `--experimental-public`. However, wrangler can be used where it's not installed in the `package.json` for the worker, or even when there's no package.json at all (like when wrangler is installed globally, or used with `npx`). In this situation, if the user doesn't have `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` installed, then building the worker will fail. We don't want to make the user install this themselves, so instead we point to a barrel import for the library in the facade for the worker.

  In projects where:

  - all the source code isn't in one folder (like a monorepo, or even where the worker has non-standard imports across folders),
  - we use a custom build, so it's hard to statically determine folders to watch for changes

  ...we'd like to be able to specify multiple paths for custom builds, (the config `build.watch_dir` config). This patch enables such behaviour. It now accepts a single path as before, or optionally an array of strings/paths.

  When generating a preview session on the edge with `wrangler dev`, for a zoned worker we were using a random id as the script ID. This would make the backend not associate the dev session with any resources that were otherwise assigned to the script (specifically for secrets, but other stuff as well) The fix is simply to use the worker name (when available) as the script ID.

  Previously, if you are not logged in when running `wrangler dev` it will only try to log you in
  if you start in "remote" mode. In "local" mode there is no need to be logged in, so it doesn't
  bother to try to login, and then will crash if you switch to "remote" mode interactively.

  The problem was that we were only attempting to login once before creating the `<Remote>` component.
  Now this logic has been moved into a `useEffect()` inside `<Remote>` so that it will be run whether
  starting in "remote" or transitioning to "remote" from "local".

  The fact that the check is no longer done before creating the components is proven by removing the
  `mockAccountId()` and `mockApiToken()` calls from the `dev.test.ts` files.

  While we wait for changes to the CF API to support API tokens that do not have

  to the Wrangler v1 approach, which sends individual route updates via a zone-based

  When `wrangler init` is used to create a new Scheduled Worker a cron trigger (1 \* \* \* \*) will be added to wrangler.toml, but only if wrangler.toml is being created during init. If wrangler.toml exists prior to running `wrangler init` then wrangler.toml will remain unchanged even if the user selects the "Scheduled Handler" option.

  Because we were calling `printBindings` during the render phase of `<Dev/>`, we were logging the bindings multiple times (render can be called multiple times, and the interaction of Ink's stdout output intermingled with console is a bit weird). We could have put it into an effect, but I think a better solution here is to simply log it before we even start rendering `<Dev/>` (so we could see the bindings even if Dev fails to load, for example).

  This also adds a fix that masks any overriden values so that we don't accidentally log potential secrets into the terminal.

  This does a small refactor -

  - During publish, we were checking whether `[migrations]` were defined in the presence of `[durable_objects]`, and warning if not. This moves it into the config validation step, which means it'll check for all commands (but notably `dev`)
  - It moves the code to determine current migration tag/migrations to upload into a helper. We'll be reusing this soon when we upload migrations to `dev`.

This adds experimental support for service bindings, aka worker-to-worker bindings. It's lets you "call" a worker from another worker, without incurring any network cost, and (ideally) with much less latency. To use it, define a `[services]` field in `wrangler.toml`, which is a map of bindings to worker names (and environment). Let's say you already have a worker named "my-worker" deployed. In another worker's configuration, you can create a service binding to it like so:

```toml
[[services]]
binding = "MYWORKER"
service = "my-worker"
environment = "production" # optional, defaults to the worker's `default_environment` for now
````

And in your worker, you can call it like so:

```js
export default {
  fetch(req, env, ctx) {
    return env.MYWORKER.fetch(new Request("http://domain/some-path"));
  },
};

  We check for the presence of Git by trying to run `git --version`.
  On non-Windows we get an Error with `code` set to "ENOENT".
  One Windows we get a different error:

  With the release of Custom Domains for workers, users can publish directly to a custom domain on a route, rather than creating a dummy DNS record first and manually pointing the worker over - this adds the same support to wrangler.

  Users declare routes as normal, but to indicate that a route should be treated as a custom domain, a user simply uses the object format in the toml file, but with a new key: custom_domain (i.e. `routes = [{ pattern = "api.example.com", custom_domain = true }]`)

  When wrangler sees a route like this, it peels them off from the rest of the routes and publishes them separately, using the /domains api. This api is very defensive, erroring eagerly if there are conflicts in existing Custom Domains or managed DNS records. In the case of conflicts, wrangler prompts for confirmation, and then retries with parameters to indicate overriding is allowed.

  On Windows, the following command `wrangler pages dev -- foo bar` would error

  A workaround is to put the command in quotes: `wrangler pages dev -- "foo bar"`.

  When we start up the CLI, we check what the minimum version of supported node is, and throw an error if it isn't at least 16.7. However, the script that runs this, imports `node:child_process` and `node:path`, which was only introduced in 16.7. It was backported to older versions of node, but only in last updates to majors. So for example, if someone used 14.15.4, the script would throw because it wouldn't be able to find `node:child_process` (but it _would_ work on v14.19.2).

  We detect whether a worker is a "modules" format worker by the presence of a `default` export. This is a pretty good heuristic overall, but sometimes folks can make mistakes. One situation that's popped up a few times, is people writing exports, but still writing it in "service worker" format. We detect this fine, and log a warning about the exports, but send it up with the exports included. Unfortunately, our runtime throws when we mark a worker as a service worker, but still has exports. This patch fixes it so that the exports are not included in a service-worker worker.

  Note that if you're missing an event listener, it'll still error with "No event handlers were registered. This script does nothing." but that's a better error than the SyntaxError _even when the listener was there_.

  When running `wrangler.init`, we look for the existence of `package.json`, / `tsconfig.json` / `.git` when deciding whether we should create them ourselves or not. Because `name` can be a relative path, we had a bug where we don't starting look from the right directory.

  When calling `wrangler dev`, we make a request to a special URL that "prewarms" the isolate running our Worker so that we can attach devtools etc to it before actually making a request. We'd implemented it wrongly, and because we'd silenced its errors, we weren't catching it.

  We have a blogposts and docs that says you need to pass `--inspect` to use devtools and/or profile your Worker. In wrangler v2, we don't need to pass the flag anymore. Using it right now will throw an error, so this patch makes it a simple warning instead.

  When errors in wrangler happen, it's hard to tell where the error is coming from in a minified bundle. This patch removes the minification. We still set `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'` in the bundle so we don't run dev-only paths in things like React.

  This adds about 2 mb to the bundle, but imo it's worth it.

  The `vars` bindings can be specified in the `wrangler.toml` configuration file.

  It is useful during development, to provide these types of variable locally.
  When running `wrangler dev` we will look for a file called `.dev.vars`, situated
  next to the `wrangler.toml` file (or in the current working directory if there is no
  `wrangler.toml`). Any values in this file, formatted like a `dotenv` file, will add to
  or override `vars` bindings provided in the `wrangler.toml`.

- [#869](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/869) [`f1423bf`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/f1423bf6399655d5c186c4849f23bb2196e4fcec) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: experimental `--node-compat` / `config.node_compat`

  This adds an experimental node.js compatibility mode. It can be enabled by adding `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`, or by passing `--node-compat` as a command line arg for `dev`/`publish` commands. This is currently powered by `@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill` (which in itself is powered by `rollup-plugin-node-polyfills`).

  We'd previously added this, and then removed it because the quality of the polyfills isn't great. We're reintroducing it regardless so we can start getting feedback on its usage, and it sets up a foundation for replacing it with our own, hopefully better maintained polyfills.

  Of particular note, this means that what we promised in https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-stripe-support-in-workers/ now actually works.

  This patch also addresses some dependency issues, specifically leftover entries in package-lock.json.

  Certain runtime APIs are only available to workers during the "request context",
  which is any code that returns after receiving a request and before returning
  a response.

  Miniflare emulates this behavior by using an [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) and
  [checking at runtime](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/blob/master/packages/shared/src/context.ts#L21-L36)
  to see if you're using those APIs during the request context.

  In certain environments `AsyncLocalStorage` is unavailable, such as in a
  [webcontainer](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core).
  This function figures out if we're able to run those "request context" checks
  and returns [a set of options](https://miniflare.dev/core/standards#global-functionality-limits)
  that indicate to miniflare whether to run the checks or not.

  This removes the timeout we have for custom builds. We shouldn't be applying this timeout anyway, since it doesn't block wrangler, just the user themselves. Further, in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/759, we changed the custom build's process stdout/stderr config to "pipe" to pass tests, however that meant we wouldn't see logs in the terminal anymore. This patch removes the timeout, and brings back proper logging for custom builds.

  This fix -

  - passes the correct query param to check whether a workers.dev subdomain has already been published/enabled
  - thus enabling it only when it's not been enabled
  - it also disables it only when it's explicitly knows it's already been enabled

  The effect of this is that publishes are much faster.

  There's some interference between our data fetching library `undici` and node 18's new `fetch` and co. (powered by `undici` internally) which replaces the filename of `File`s attached to `FormData`s with a generic `blob` (likely this code - https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/615f6170f4bd39630224c038d1ea5bf505d292af/lib/fetch/formdata.js#L246-L250). It's still not clear why it does so, and it's hard to make an isolated example of this.

  Regardless, disabling the new `fetch` functionality makes `undici` use its own base classes, avoiding the problem for now, and unblocking our release. We'll keep investigating and look for a proper fix.

  It can be useful to do a dry run of publishing. Developers want peace of mind that a project will compile before actually publishing to live servers. Combined with `--outdir`, this is also useful for testing the output of `publish`. Further, it gives developers a chance to upload our generated sourcemap to a service like sentry etc, so that errors from the worker can be mapped against actual source code, but before the service actually goes live.

  With `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` in `dev`, we were clobbering a single folder with data from kv/do/cache. This patch gives individual folders for them. It also enables persistence even when this is not true, but that stays only for the length of a session, and cleans itself up when the dev session ends.

  We currently log an `AbortError` with a stack if we exit `wrangler dev`'s startup process before it's done. This fix skips logging that error (since it's not an exception).

  It can be useful to introspect built assets. A leading usecase is to upload the sourcemap that we generate to services like sentry etc, so that errors from the worker can be mapped against actual source code. We introduce a `--outdir` cli arg to specify a path to generate built assets at, which doesn't get cleaned up after publishing. We are _not_ adding this to `wrangler.toml` just yet, but could in the future if it looks appropriate there.

  This enables optionally passing a route as `{pattern: string, zone_id: string}`. There are scenarios where we need to explicitly pass a zone_id to the api, so this enables that.

  Some nuance: The errors from the api aren't super useful when invalid values are passed, but that's something to further work on.

  If a user hasn't logged in and then they run a command that needs a login they'll get bounced to the login flow.
  The login flow (if completed) would write their shiny new OAuth2 credentials to disk, but wouldn't reload the

  wouldn't be aware of it.

  When a developer uses `--env` to specify an environment name, the Worker name should
  be computed from the top-level Worker name and the environment name.

  When the given environment name does not match those in the wrangler.toml, we error.
  But if no environments have been specified in the wrangler.toml, at all, then we only
  log a warning and continue.

  In this second case, we were reusing the top-level environment, which did not have the
  correct legacy environment fields set, such as the name. Now we ensure that such an
  environment is created as needed.

  When `workers_dev` is not configured, we had a bug where it would default to true inside an environment even when there were routes defined, thus publishing both to a `workers.dev` subdomain as well as the defined routes.

  - We consider jsx to be regular js, and have setup our esbuild process to process js/mjs/cjs files as jsx.

  We don't want to have, for example, a KV namespace named "DATA"
  and a Durable Object also named "DATA". Then it would be ambiguous
  what exactly would live at `env.DATA` (or in the case of service workers,
  the `DATA` global) which could lead to unexpected behavior -- and errors.

  Similarly, we don't want to have multiple resources of the same type
  bound to the same name. If you've been working with some KV namespace
  called "DATA", and you add a second namespace but don't change the binding
  to something else (maybe you're copying-and-pasting and just changed out the `id`),
  you could be reading entirely the wrong stuff out of your KV store.

  So now we check for those sorts of situations and throw an error if
  we find that we've encountered one.

  An extremely common pattern in the js ecosystem is to add additional behaviour gated by the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV`. For example, React leverages it heavily to add dev-time checks and warnings/errors, and to load dev/production versions of code. By doing this substitution ourselves, we can get a significant runtime boost in libraries/code that leverage this.

  This does NOT tackle the additional features of either minification, or proper node compatibility, or injecting wrangler's own environment name, which we will tackle in future PRs.

  Now, when we normalize and validate the raw config, we pass in the currently
  active environment name, and the config that is returned contains all the
  environment fields correctly normalized (including inheritance) at the top
  level of the config object. This avoids other commands from having to check
  both the current named environment and the top-level config for such fields.

  Also, now, handle the case where the active environment name passed in via the
  `--env` command line argument does not match any of the named environments
  in the configuration:

  - This is an error if there are named environments configured;
  - or only a warning if there are no named environments configured.

  We rely on Chromium-based devtools for debugging workers, so when opening up the devtools URL,
  we should force a chromium-based browser to launch. For now, this means checking (in order)
  for Chrome and Edge, and then failing if neither of those are available.

  This consolidates some logic into `getEntry()`, namely including `guessWorkerFormat()` and custom builds. This simplifies the code for both `dev` and `publish`.

  - Previously, the implementation of custom builds inside `dev` assumed it could be a long running process; however it's not (else consider that `publish` would never work).
  - By running custom builds inside `getEntry()`, we can be certain that the entry point exists as we validate it and before we enter `dev`/`publish`, simplifying their internals
  - We don't have to do periodic checks inside `wrangler dev` because it's now a one shot build (and always should have been)
  - This expands test coverage a little for both `dev` and `publish`.
  - The 'format' of a worker is intrinsic to its contents, so it makes sense to establish its value inside `getEntry()`
  - This also means less async logic inside `<Dev/>`, which is always a good thing

  This implements Wrangler v1.x style module specifiers, but also logs a deprecation warning for every usage.

  Consider a project like so:

  ```
    project
    ├── index.js
    └── some-dependency.js
  ```

  where the content of `index.js` is:

  ```jsx
  import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";

  addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {});
  ```

  `wrangler` 1.x would resolve `import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";` to the file `some-dependency.js`. This will work in `wrangler` v2, but it will log a deprecation warning. Instead, you should rewrite the import to specify that it's a relative path, like so:

  ```diff
  - import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";
  + import SomeDependency from "./some-dependency.js";
  ```

  In a near future version, this will become a breaking deprecation and throw an error.

  (This also updates `workers-chat-demo` to use the older style specifier, since that's how it currently is at https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo)

  Known issue: This might not work as expected with `.js`/`.cjs`/`.mjs` files as expected, but that's something to be fixed overall with the module system.

  This is an alternate fix to https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/pull/205, and fixes the error where miniflare would get confused resolving relative modules on macs because of `/var`/`/private/var` being symlinks. Instead, we `realpathSync` the bundle path before passing it on to miniflare, and that appears to fix the problem.

  Sentry's SDK automatically tracks "breadcrumbs", which are pieces of information
  that get tracked leading up to an exception. This can be useful for debugging
  errors because it gives better insight into what happens before an error occurs,
  so you can more easily understand and recreate exactly what happened before an
  error occurred.

  Unfortunately, Sentry automatically includes all `console` statements. And since
  we use the console a lot (e.g. logging every request received in `wrangler dev`),
  this is mostly useless. Additionally, since developers frequently use the console
  to debug their workers we end up with a bunch of data that is not only irrelevant
  to the reported error, but also contains data that could be potentially sensitive.

  For now, we're turning off breadcrumbs entirely. Later, we might wish to add our
  own breadcrumbs manually (e.g. add a "wrangler dev" breadcrumb when a user runs
  `wrangler dev`), at which point we can selectively enable breadcrumbs to catch
  only the ones we've put in there ourselves.

  This change adds full support for the setting the protocol that the localhost proxy server listens to.
  Previously, it was only possible to use `HTTP`. But now you can set it to `HTTPS` as well.

  To support `HTTPS`, Wrangler needs an SSL certificate.
  Wrangler now generates a self-signed certificate, as needed, and caches it in the `~/.wrangler/local-cert` directory.
  These certificates expire after 30 days and are regenerated by Wrangler as needed.

  Note that if you use HTTPS then your browser will complain about the self-signed and you must tell it to accept the certificate before it will let you access the page.

  Previously, the `useLocalWorker()` hook was being passed the wrong port for the `inspectorPort` prop.

  which also means that `Remote` benefits from this check too.

  This expires any previously uploaded assets when using a Sites / `[site]` configuration. Because we currently do a full iteration of a namespace's keys when publishing, for rapidly changing sites this means that uploads get slower and slower. We can't just delete unused assets because it leads to occasional 404s on older publishes while we're publishing. So we expire previous assets while uploading new ones. The implementation/constraints of the kv api means that uploads may become slower, but should hopefully be faster overall. These optimisations also only matter for rapidly changing sites, so common usecases still have the same perf characteristics.

  If you use the deprecated variables they will still work but you will see a warning message.

  Within the Cloudflare tooling ecosystem, we have a mix of `CF_` and `CLOUDFLARE_`
  for prefixing environment variables. Until recently, many of the tools
  were fine with `CF_` however, there started to be conflicts with
  external tools (such as Cloudfoundary CLI), which also uses `CF_` as a
  prefix, and would potentially be reading and writing the same value the
  Cloudflare tooling.

  The Go SDK[1], Terraform[2] and cf-terraforming[3] have made the jump to
  the `CLOUDFLARE_` prefix for environment variable prefix.

  In future, all SDKs will use this prefix for consistency and to allow all the tooling to reuse the same environment variables in the scenario where they are present.

  We should be consistent with the word that describes how we get a worker to the edge. The command is `publish`, so let's use that everywhere.

  We'd originally planned for `--local` mode to be a thing across all wrangler commands. In hindsight, that didn't make much sense, since every command other than `wrangler dev` assumes some interaction with cloudflare and their API. The only command other than dev where this "worked" was `kv`, but even that didn't make sense because wrangler dev wouldn't even read from it. We also have `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` there anyway.

  So this moves the `--local` flag to only apply for `wrangler dev` and removes any trace from other commands.

  This implements support for `[text_blobs]` as defined by https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1677.

  Text blobs can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in `wrangler.toml` as -

  ```
  [text_blobs]
  MYTEXT = "./path/to/my-text.file"
  ```

  The content of the file will then be available as the global `MYTEXT` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  Workers Sites now uses `[text_blobs]` internally. Previously, we were inlining the asset manifest into the worker itself, but we now attach the asset manifest to the uploaded worker. I also added an additional example of Workers Sites with a modules format worker.

  This implements service environments + `wrangler dev`. Fairly simple, it just needed the right url when creating the edge preview token.

  I tested this by publishing a service under one env, adding secrets under it in the dashboard, and then trying to dev under another env, and verifying that the secrets didn't leak.

  Previously when running `wrangler dev` on multiple workers at the same time, you couldn't attach DevTools to both workers, since they were both listening on port 9229.
  With this PR, that behavior is improved -- you can now pass an `--inspector-port` flag to specify a port for DevTools to connect to on a per-worker basis, or
  if the option is omitted, wrangler will assign a random unused port for you.

  This "if no option is given, assign a random unused port" behavior has also been added to `wrangler dev --port`, so running `wrangler dev` on two
  workers at once should now "just work". Hopefully.

  This implements support for zoned workers in `wrangler dev`. Of note, since we're deprecating `zone_id`, we instead use the domain provided via `--host`/`config.dev.host`/`--routes`/`--route`/`config.routes`/`config.route` and infer the zone id from it.

  This is the first step in making a standard format for error messages. For now, this uses esbuild's error formatting, which is nice and colored, but we could decide to customize our own later.

  The `preview` command is deprecated and not supported in this version of Wrangler.
  Instead, one should use the `dev` command for most `preview` use-cases.

  This change attempts to delegate any use of `preview` to `dev` failing if the command line contains positional arguments that are not compatible with `dev`.

  There was a common chunk of code across most commands that ensures a user is logged in, and retrieves an account ID. I'd resisted making this into an abstraction for a while. Now that the codebase is stable, and https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/537 removes some surrounding code there, I made an abstraction for this common code as `requireAuth()`. This gets a mention in the changelog simply because it touches a bunch of code, although it's mostly mechanical deletion/replacement.

  Currently, when creating a new project, we usually first have to create a directory before running `wrangler init`, since it defaults to creating the `wrangler.toml`, `package.json`, etc in the current working directory. This fix introduces an enhancement, where using the `wrangler init [name]` form creates a directory named `[name]` and initialises the project files inside it. This matches the usage pattern a little better, and still preserves the older behaviour when we're creating a worker inside existing projects.

  The configuration for a Worker is complicated since we can define different "environments", and each environment can have its own configuration.
  There is a default ("top-level") environment and then named environments that provide environment specific configuration.

  This is further complicated by the fact that there are three kinds of environment configuration:

  - **non-overridable**: these values are defined once in the top-level configuration, apply to all environments and cannot be overridden by an environment.
  - **inheritable**: these values can be defined at the top-level but can also be overridden by environment specific values.
    Named environments do not need to provide their own values, in which case they inherit the value from the top-level.
  - **non-inheritable**: these values must be explicitly defined in each environment if they are defined at the top-level.
    Named environments do not inherit such configuration and must provide their own values.

  All configuration values in `wrangler.toml` are optional and will receive a default value if not defined.

  This change adds more strict interfaces for top-level `Config` and `Environment` types,
  as well as validation and normalization of the optional fields that are read from `wrangler.toml`.

  We were warning if you were trying to develop a durable object with an unnamed worker. Further, the internal api would actually throw if you tried to develop with a named worker if it wasn't already published. The latter is being fixed internally and should live soon, and this fix removes the warning completely.

  During `dev` and `publish`, we should resolve `wrangler.toml` starting from the entrypoint, and then working up from there. Currently, we start from the directory from which we call `wrangler`, this changes that behaviour to start from the entrypoint instead.

  (To implement this, I made one big change: Inside commands, we now have to explicitly read configuration from a path, instead of expecting it to 'arrive' coerced into a configuration object.)

Supported options:

  - `--status cancelled --status error` --> you can filter on `ok`, `error`, and `cancelled` to only tail logs that have that status
  - `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER:somevalue` --> you can filter on headers, including ones that have specific values (`"somevalue"`) or just that contain any header (e.g. `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER` with no colon)
  - `--method POST --method PUT` --> filter on the HTTP method used to trigger the worker
  - `--search catch-this` --> only shows messages that contain the phrase `"catch-this"`. Does not (yet!) support regular expressions
  - `--ip self --ip 192.0.2.232` --> only show logs from requests that originate from the given IP addresses. `"self"` will be replaced with the IP address of the computer that sent the tail request.

  This formalises the logic we use to "guess"/infer what a worker's format is - either "modules" or "service worker". Previously we were using the output of the esbuild process metafile to infer this, we now explicitly do so in a separate step (esbuild's so fast that it doesn't have any apparent performance hit, but we also do a simpler form of the build to get this information).

  This also adds `--format` as a command line arg for `publish`.

  Adds support for "unsafe bindings", that is, bindings that aren't supported by wrangler, but are

  We open browser windows for a few things; during `wrangler dev`, and logging in. There are environments where this doesn't work as expected (like codespaces, stackblitz, etc).

  Now that we have `[[unsafe.bindings]]` (as of https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/411), we should use that for experimental features. This removes support for `[experimental_services]`, and adds a helpful message for how to rewrite their configuration.

  This error is temporary, until the internal teams that were using this rewrite their configs. We'll remove it before GA.

  What the error looks like -

  ```
  Error: The "experimental_services" field is no longer supported. Instead, use [[unsafe.bindings]] to enable experimental features. Add this to your wrangler.toml:

  [[unsafe.bindings]]
  name = "SomeService"
  type = "service"

  wasm modules can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in wrangler.toml as -

  ```
  [wasm_modules]
  MYWASM = "./path/to/my-wasm.wasm"
  ```

  The module will then be available as the global `MYWASM` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  (In the future, we MAY enable wasm module imports in service-worker format (i.e. `import MYWASM from './path/to/my-wasm.wasm'`) and global imports inside modules format workers.)

  The api for fetching a kv value, unlike every other cloudflare api, returns just the raw value as a string (as opposed to the `FetchResult`-style json). However, our fetch utility tries to convert every api response to json before parsing it further. This leads to bugs like https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/359.

  - Don't rely on bash variables to configure tests
    The use of bash variables in the `npm test` script is not supported in Windows Powershell, causing CI on Windows to fail.
    These bash variables are used to override the API token and the Account ID.

    This change moves the control of mocking these two concepts into the test code, by adding `mockAccountId()` and `mockApiToken()` helpers.

    - The result is slightly more boilerplate in tests that need to avoid hitting the auth APIs.
    - But there are other tests that had to revert these environment variables. So the boilerplate is reduced there.

  - Sanitize command line for snapshot tests
    This change applies `normalizeSlashes()` and `trimTimings()` to command line outputs and error messages to avoid inconsistencies in snapshots.
    The benefit here is that authors do not need to keep adding them to all their snapshot tests.

  - Move all the helper functions into their own directory to keep the test directory cleaner.

  There are several reasons to replace `node-fetch` with `undici`:

  - `undici`'s `fetch()` implementation is set to become node's standard `fetch()` implementation, which means we can just remove the dependency in the future (or optionally load it depending on which version of node is being used)
  - `node-fetch` pollutes the global type space with a number of standard types
  - we already bundle `undici` via `miniflare`/pages, so this means our bundle size could ostensibly become smaller.

  This replaces `node-fetch` with `undici`.

  - All instances of `import fetch from "node-fetch"` are replaced with `import {fetch} from "undici"`
  - `undici` also comes with spec compliant forms of `FormData` and `File`, so we could also remove `formdata-node` in `form_data.ts`
  - All the global types that were injected by `node-fetch` are now imported from `undici` (as well as some mistaken ones from `node:url`)
  - NOTE: this also turns on `skipLibCheck` in `tsconfig.json`. Some dependencies oddly depend on browser globals like `Request`, `Response` (like `@miniflare/core`, `jest-fetch-mock`, etc), which now fail because `node-fetch` isn't injecting those globals anymore. So we enable `skipLibCheck` to bypass them. (I'd thought `skipLibCheck` completely ignores 'third party' types, but that's not true - it still uses the module graph to scan types. So we're still typesafe. We should enable `strict` sometime to avoid `any`s, but that's for later.)
  - The bundle size isn't smaller because we're bundling 2 different versions of `undici`, but we'll fix that by separately upping the version of `undici` that miniflare bundles.

  - This adds `eslint-plugin-import` to enforce ordering of imports, and configuration for the same in `package.json`.
  - I also run `npm run check:lint -- --fix` to apply the configured order in our whole codebase.
  - This also needs a setting in `.vscode/settings.json` to prevent spurious warnings inside vscode. You'll probably have to restart your IDE for this to take effect. (re: https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2377#issuecomment-1024800026)

  (I'd also like to enforce using `node:` prefixes for node builtin modules, but that can happen later. For now I manually added the prefixes wherever they were missing. It's not functionally any different, but imo it helps the visual grouping.)

  This adds support for `*.wasm` modules into local mode for `wrangler dev`.

  In 'edge' mode, we create a javascript bundle, but wasm modules are uploaded to the preview server directly when making the worker definition form upload. However, in 'local' mode, we need to have the actual modules available to the bundle. So we copy the files over to the bundle path. We also pass appropriate `--modules-rule` directive to `miniflare`.

  I also added a sample wasm app to use for testing, created from a default `workers-rs` project.

  Previously we were caching all the `node_modules` files in the CI jobs and then running `npm install`. While this resulted in slightly improved install times on Ubuntu, it breaks on Windows because the npm workspace setup adds symlinks into node_modules, which the Github cache action cannot cope with.

  This change removes the `node_modules` caches (saving some time by not needing to restore them) and replaces `npm install` with `npm ci`.

  The `npm ci` command is actually designed to be used in CI jobs as it only installs the exact versions specified in the `package-lock.json` file, guaranteeing that for any commit we always have exactly the same CI job run, deterministically.

  It turns out that, on Ubuntu, using `npm ci` makes very little difference to the installation time (~30 secs), especially if there is no `node_modules` there in the first place.

  Unfortunately, MacOS is slower (~1 min), and Windows even worse (~2 mins)! But it is worth this longer CI run to be sure we have things working on all OSes.

  This fix passes the correct worker name to `syncAssets` during `wrangler dev`. This function uses the name to create the backing kv store for a Workers Sites definition, so it's important we get the name right.

  I also fixed the lint warning introduced in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/321, to pass `props.enableLocalPersistence` as a dependency in the `useEffect` call that starts the "local" mode dev server.

  When fetching a list of results from cloudflare APIs (e.g. when fetching a list of keys in a kv namespace), the api returns a `cursor` that a consumer should use to get the next 'page' of results. It appears this cursor can also be a blank string (while we'd only account for it to be `undefined`). By only accounting for it to be `undefined`, we were infinitely looping through the same page of results and never terminating. This PR fixes it by letting it be a blank string (and `null`, for good measure)

  When we run `wrangler dev`, we start a server on a port (defaulting to 8787). We do this separately for both local and edge modes. However, when switching between the two with the `l` hotkey, we don't 'wait' for the previous server to stop before starting the next one. This can crash the process, and we don't want that (of course). So we introduce a helper function `waitForPortToBeAvailable()` that waits for a port to be available before returning. This is used in both the local and edge modes, and prevents the bug right now, where switching between edge - local - edge crashes the process.

  (This isn't a complete fix, and we can still cause errors by very rapidly switching between the two modes. A proper long term fix for the future would probably be to hoist the proxy server hook above the `<Remote/>` and `<Local/>` components, and use a single instance throughout.

  We were adding text-like modules (i.e. `.txt`, `.html` and `.pem` files) as separate modules in the Worker definition, but this only really 'works' with the ES module Worker format. This commit changes that to inline the text-like files into the Worker bundle directly.

  We still have to do something similar with `.wasm` modules, but that requires a different fix, and we'll do so in a subsequent commit.

  This adds support for Workers Sites in local mode when running wrangler `dev`. Further, it fixes a bug where we were sending the `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST` definition as a separate module even with service worker format, and a bug where we weren't uploading the namespace binding when other kv namespaces weren't present.

  This PR implements `wrangler secret` for `--local` mode. The implementation is simply a no-op, since we don't want to actually write secret values to disk (I think?). I also got the messaging for remote mode right by copying from Wrangler v1. Further, I added tests for all the `wrangler secret` commands.

  When we run `wrangler dev`, the session that we setup with the preview endpoint doesn't last forever, it dies after ignoring it for 5-15 minutes or so. The fix for this is to simply reconnect the server. So we use a state hook as a sigil, and add it to the dependency array of the effect that sets up the server, and simply change it every time the server closes.

  Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/197

  (In Wrangler v1, we used to restart the whole process, including uploading the worker again, making a new preview token, and so on. It looks like that they may not have been necessary.)

  We were using `--prefer-offline` when running `npm install` during `wrangler init`. The behaviour is odd, it doesn't seem to fetch from the remote when the cache isn't hit, which is not what I'm expecting. So we remove `--prefer-offline`.

  We were running custom builds as a regular command with `execa`. This would fail whenever we tried to run compound commands like `cargo install -q worker-build && worker-build --release` (via https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/236). The fix is to use `shell: true`, so that the command is run in a shell and can thus use bash-y syntax like `&&`, and so on. I also switched to using `execaCommand` which splits a command string into parts correctly by itself.

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  When running `dev` locally any data stored in KV, Durable Objects or the cache are no longer persisted between sessions by default.

  To turn this back on add the `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` at the command line.

  This PR adds some enhancements/fixes to the `wrangler init` command.

  - doesn't overwrite `wrangler.toml` if it already exists
  - installs `wrangler` when creating `package.json`
  - offers to install `wrangler` into `package.json` even if `package.json` already exists
  - offers to install `@cloudflare/workers-types` even if `tsconfig.json` already exists
  - pipes stdio back to the terminal so there's feedback when it's installing npm packages

  This does have the side effect of making out tests slower. I added `--prefer-offline` to the `npm install` calls to make this a shade quicker, but I can't figure out a good way of mocking these. I'll think about it some more later. We should work on making the installs themselves quicker (re: https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/66)

  This PR also fixes a bug with our tests - `runWrangler` would catch thrown errors, and if we didn't manually verify the error, tests would pass. Instead, it now throws correctly, and I modified all the tests to assert on thrown errors. It seems like a lot, but it was just mechanical rewriting.

  This PR adds more special logic for some data types that get logged via `console` methods. Types like `Promise`, `Date`, `WeakMaps`, and some more, now get logged correctly (or at least, better than they used to).

  This PR also fixes a sinister bug - the `type` of the `ConsoleAPICalled` events don't match 1:1 with actual console methods (eg: `console.warn` message type is `warning`). This PR adds a mapping between those types and method names. Some methods don't seem to have a message type, I'm not sure why, but we'll get to them later.

  This adds an assertion error for making sure a `[site]` definition always has a `bucket` field.As a cleanup, I made some small fixes to the `Config` type definition, and modified the tests in `publish.test.ts` to use the config format when creating a `wrangler.toml` file.

  When we pass a non-js file as entry to esbuild, it generates a `.js` file. (which, is the whole job of esbuild, haha). So, given `<source>/index.ts`, it'll generate `<destination>/index.js`. However, when we try to 'find' the matching file to pass on as an input to creating the actual worker, we try to use the original file name inside the destination directory. At this point, the extension has changed, so it doesn't find the file, and hence we get the error that looks like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/folders/3f/fwp6mt7n13bfnkd5vl3jmh1w0000gp/T/tmp-61545-4Y5kwyNI8DGU/src/worker.ts'`

  The actual path to the destination file is actually the key of the block in `metafile.outputs` that matches the given output.entryPoint, so this PR simply rewrites the logic to use that instead.

  Any errors embedded in the response from the Cloudflare API were being lost, because `fetchInternal()` would throw on a non-200 response. This PR fixes that behaviour:

  - It doesn't throw on non-200 responses
  - It first gets the response text with `.text()` and converts it to an object with `JSON.parse`, so in case the api returns a non json response, we don't lose response we were sent.

  Unfortunately, because of the nature of this abstraction, we do lose the response `status` code and `statusText`, but maybe that's acceptable since we have richer error information in the payload. I considered logging the code and text to the terminal, but that may make it noisy.

  The `publish` command was failing when the entry-point was specified in the wrangler.toml file and the entry-point imported another file.

  This was because we were using the `metafile.inputs` to guess the entry-point file path. But the order in which the source-files were added to this object was not well defined, and so we could end up failing to find a match.

  This fix avoids this by using the fact that the `metadata.outputs` object will only contain one element that has the `entrypoint` property - and then using that as the entry-point path. For runtime safety, we now assert that there cannot be zero or multiple such elements.

  This PR refactors how we setup the proxy server between the developer and the edge preview service during `wrangler dev`. Of note, we start the server immediately. We also buffer requests/streams and hold on to them, when starting/refreshing the token. This means a developer should never see `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error page, or have an older worker respond after making a change to the code. And when the token does get refreshed, we flush said streams/requests with the newer values, making the iteration process a lot smoother and predictable.

  Most API responses are JSON of the form:

  ```
  { result, success, errors, messages, result_info }
  ```

  where the `result` contains the actual response value.

  But some API responses only contain the result value.

  This change refactors the client-side fetch API to allow callers to specify what kind of response they expect.

  - A cli arg for adding a compatibility data, e.g `--compatibility_date 2022-01-05`
  - A shorthand `--latest` that sets `compatibility_date` to today's date. Usage of this flag logs a warning.
  - `latest` is NOT a config field in `wrangler.toml`.
  - In `dev`, when a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg, then we default to `--latest`.
  - In `publish` we error if a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg. Usage of `--latest` logs a warning.
  - We also accept compatibility flags via the cli, e.g: `--compatibility-flags formdata_parser_supports_files`

  This was already done in `wrangler pages dev`, so this change just exposes this build command for use in our build image, or for people who want to do it themselves.

  This lets developers use the same file-based routing system an simplified syntax when developing their own Workers!

- [#199](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/199) [`d9ecb70`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/d9ecb7070ac692550497c8dfb3627e7badae4438) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Refactor inspection/debugging code -

  - I've installed devtools-protocol, a convenient package that has the static types for the devtools protocol (duh) autogenerated from chrome's devtools codebase.
  - We now log messages and exceptions into the terminal directly, so you don't have to open devtools to see those messages.
  - Messages are now buffered until a devtools instance connects, so you won't lose any messages while devtools isn't connected.
  - We don't lose the connection on making changes to the worker, removing the need for the kludgy hack on the devtools side (where we refresh the whole page when there's a change)

  When doing a list request to the API, the server may respond with only a single page of results.
  In this case, it will also provide a `cursor` value in the `result_info` part of the response, which can be used to request the next page.
  This change implements this on the client-side so that we get all the results by requesting further pages when there is a cursor.

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 1fdcfe3: Subfolder Relative Pathing Fix issue #147
  The filename from args didn't handle relative paths passed in from users with scripts in subfolders.
  To handle the subfolder pathing a path.relative using cwd() to user input filepath to the filepath variable passed into Dev
- 0330ecf: Adds the Content-Type header when serving assets with `wrangler pages dev`. It guesses the mime-type based on the asset's file extension.
- eaf40e8: Improve the error message for bad `kv:namespace delete` commands
- 562d3ad: chore: enable eslint's no-shadow rule
- 9cef492: Adds the logic of @cloudflare/pages-functions-compiler directly into wrangler. This generates a Worker from a folder of functions.

  Also adds support for sourcemaps and automatically watching dependents to trigger a re-build.

- 3426c13: fix: prevent `useWorker`'s inifinite restarts during `dev`
- e9a1820: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.5`
- 7156e39: Pass bindings correctly to miniflare/child_process.spawn in `dev`, to prevent miniflare from erroring out on startup
- ce2d7d1: Add experimental support for worker-to-worker service bindings. This introduces a new field in configuration `experimental_services`, and serialises it when creating and uploading a worker definition. This is highly experimental, and doesn't work with `wrangler dev` yet.
- 072566f: Fixed KV getNamespaceId preview flag bug
- 5856807: Improve validation message for `kv:namespace create`

  Previously, if the user passed multiple positional arguments (which is invalid)
  the error message would suggest that these should be grouped in quotes.
  But this is also wrong, since a namespace binding name must not contain spaces.

- 34ad323: Refactor the way we convert configurations for bindings all the way through to the API where we upload a worker definition. This commit preserves the configuration structure (mostly) until the point we serialise it for the API. This prevents the way we use duck typing to detect a binding type when uploading, makes the types a bit simpler, and makes it easier to add other types of bindings in the future (notably, the upcoming service bindings.)

### Patch Changes

- 421f2e4: Update base version to 0.0.5, copy the README to packages/wrangler

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- cea27fe: don't log file contents when writing via `kv:key put <key> --path <path>`
- b53cbc8: CI/CD
  - Release flow triggered on PR's closed
- 43e7a82: When using `wrangler pages dev`, enable source maps and log unhandled rejections
- c716abc: Error and exit if the `--type` option is used for the `init` command.

  The `--type` option is no longer needed, nor supported.

  The type of a project is implicitly javascript, even if it includes a wasm (e.g. built from rust).

  Projects that would have had the `webpack` type need to be configured separately to have a custom build.

- 3752acf: Add support for websockets in `dev`, i.e. when developing workers. This replaces the proxy layer that we use to connect to the 'edge' during preview mode, using the `faye-wesocket` library.
- c7bee70: Patches typing mismatches between us, undici and miniflare when proxying requests in pages dev, and also adds fallback 404 behavior which was missed
- 8b6c2d1: Add more fields to the `tsconfig.json` generated by `wrangler init`
- 78cd080: Custom builds for `dev` and `publish`
- cd05d20: import text file types into workers
- 1216fc9: Export regular functions from dialog.ts, pass tests (followup from https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/124)
- 6fc4c50: Display error message when unknown command is provided to the wrangler CLI.
- 23543fe: Allow the developer to exit `init` if there is already a toml file
- 1df6b0c: enable @typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises, pass lint+type check
- 3c5725f: CI/CD Cleanup
  - Removed the build step from tests, which should speed up the "Tests" Workflow.
  - Added a branch specific trigger for "Release", now the Workflow for "Release" should only work on PRs closed to `main`
  - Removed the "Changeset PR" Workflow. Now the "Release" Workflow will handle everything needed for Changesets.
- fb0eae7: support importing `.wasm` files / `workers-rs` support
- e928f94: Improve support for package exports conditionals, including "worker" condition
- 43e7a82: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.4`
- f473942: Replaces the static asset server with a more faithful simulation of what happens with a production Pages project.

  Also improves error handling and automatically opens the browser when running `wrangler pages dev`.

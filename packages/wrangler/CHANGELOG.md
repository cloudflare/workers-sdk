### Patch Changes

- [#557](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/557) [`835c3ae`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/835c3ae061f7b0dd67fa5e0bd56c445cb6666bf8) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: wrangler dev on unnamed workers in remote mode

  With unnamed workers, we use the filename as the name of the worker, which isn't a valid name for workers because of the `.` (This break was introduced in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/545). The preview service accepts unnamed workers and generates a hash anyway, so the fix is to simply not send it, and use the host that the service provides.

  This implements environment support for `wrangler secret` (both legacy and services). We now consistently generate the right script name across commands with the `getScriptName()` helper.

  Based on the work by @mitchelvanbever in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/95.

- [#437](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/437) [`2805205`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/2805205d83fa6c960351d38517c8a4169067e4e6) Thanks [@jacobbednarz](https://github.com/jacobbednarz)! - feat: use `CLOUDFLARE_...` environment variables deprecating `CF_...`

  Now one should use `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_BASE_URL` rather than `CF_API_TOKEN`, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_API_BASE_URL`, which have been deprecated.

  If you use the deprecated variables they will still work but you will see a warning message.

  Within the Cloudflare tooling ecosystem, we have a mix of `CF_` and `CLOUDFLARE_`
  for prefixing environment variables. Until recently, many of the tools
  were fine with `CF_` however, there started to be conflicts with
  external tools (such as Cloudfoundary CLI), which also uses `CF_` as a
  prefix, and would potentially be reading and writing the same value the
  Cloudflare tooling.

  The Go SDK[1], Terraform[2] and cf-terraforming[3] have made the jump to
  the `CLOUDFLARE_` prefix for environment variable prefix.

  In future, all SDKs will use this prefix for consistency and to allow all the tooling to reuse the same environment variables in the scenario where they are present.

  This implements the top level `rules` configuration field. It lets you specify transport rules for non-js modules. For example, you can specify `*.md` files to be included as a text file with -

  ```
  [[rules]]
  {type = "Text", globs = ["**/*.md"]}
  ```

  We also include a default ruleset -

  ```
    { type: "Text", globs: ["**/*.txt", "**/*.html"] },
    { type: "Data", globs: ["**/*.bin"] },
    { type: "CompiledWasm", globs: ["**/*.wasm"] },
  ```

  More info at https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/configuration/#build.

  Known issues -

  - non-wasm module types do not work in `--local` mode
  - `Data` type does not work in service worker format, in either mode

  This adds some tests for publishing routes, and fixes a couple of bugs with the flow.

  - fixes publishing environment specific routes, closes https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/513
  - default `workers_dev` to `false` if there are any routes specified
  - catches a hanging promise when we were toggling off a `workers.dev` subdomain (which should have been caught by the `no-floating-promises` lint rule, so that's concerning)
  - this also fixes publishing environment specific crons, but I'll write tests for that when I'm doing that feature in depth

  This implements a top level `main` field for `wrangler.toml` to define an entry point for the worker , and adds a deprecation warning for `build.upload.main`. The deprecation warning is detailed enough to give the exact line to copy-paste into your config file. Example -

  ```
  The `build.upload` field is deprecated. Delete the `build.upload` field, and add this to your configuration file:

  main = "src/chat.mjs"
  ```

  This also makes `./dist` a default for `build.upload.dir`, to match wrangler 1's behaviour.

  This fixes websockets in `wrangler dev`. It looks like we broke it in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/503. I've reverted the specific changes made to `proxy.ts`.

  Test plan -

  ```
  cd packages/wrangler

  We should be consistent with the word that describes how we get a worker to the edge. The command is `publish`, so let's use that everywhere.

- [#537](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/537) [`b978db4`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/b978db400e5c56d393e4f469b3ca5557994f8102) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: `--local` mode only applies in `wrangler dev`

  We'd originally planned for `--local` mode to be a thing across all wrangler commands. In hindsight, that didn't make much sense, since every command other than `wrangler dev` assumes some interaction with cloudflare and their API. The only command other than dev where this "worked" was `kv`, but even that didn't make sense because wrangler dev wouldn't even read from it. We also have `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` there anyway.

  So this moves the `--local` flag to only apply for `wrangler dev` and removes any trace from other commands.

* [#518](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/518) [`72f035e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/72f035e47a586fd02278674b1b160f5cb34d1412) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: implement `[text_blobs]`

  This implements support for `[text_blobs]` as defined by https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/1677.

  Text blobs can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in `wrangler.toml` as -

  ```
  [text_blobs]
  MYTEXT = "./path/to/my-text.file"
  ```

  The content of the file will then be available as the global `MYTEXT` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  Workers Sites now uses `[text_blobs]` internally. Previously, we were inlining the asset manifest into the worker itself, but we now attach the asset manifest to the uploaded worker. I also added an additional example of Workers Sites with a modules format worker.

  This implements service environments + `wrangler dev`. Fairly simple, it just needed the right url when creating the edge preview token.

  I tested this by publishing a service under one env, adding secrets under it in the dashboard, and then trying to dev under another env, and verifying that the secrets didn't leak.

  Added the following:

  - When the deletion completes, we get `Success!` logged to the console.
  - Before deleting, the user is now asked to confirm is that is desired.
  - A new flag `--force`/`-f` to avoid the confirmation check.

  While implementing support for service environments, we unearthed a small number of usage issues. While we work those out, we should default to using regular "legacy" environments.

* [#519](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/519) [`93576a8`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/93576a853b6eff3810bdccb4b7496d77b5eb5416) Thanks [@caass](https://github.com/caass)! - fix: Improve port selection for `wrangler dev` for both worker ports and inspector ports.

  Previously when running `wrangler dev` on multiple workers at the same time, you couldn't attach DevTools to both workers, since they were both listening on port 9229.
  With this PR, that behavior is improved -- you can now pass an `--inspector-port` flag to specify a port for DevTools to connect to on a per-worker basis, or
  if the option is omitted, wrangler will assign a random unused port for you.

  This "if no option is given, assign a random unused port" behavior has also been added to `wrangler dev --port`, so running `wrangler dev` on two
  workers at once should now "just work". Hopefully.

  This implements support for zoned workers in `wrangler dev`. Of note, since we're deprecating `zone_id`, we instead use the domain provided via `--host`/`config.dev.host`/`--routes`/`--route`/`config.routes`/`config.route` and infer the zone id from it.

  This is the first step in making a standard format for error messages. For now, this uses esbuild's error formatting, which is nice and colored, but we could decide to customize our own later. Moreover, we should use the `parseJSON`, `parseTOML`, and `readFile` utilities so there are pretty errors for any configuration.

  The `preview` command is deprecated and not supported in this version of Wrangler.
  Instead, one should use the `dev` command for most `preview` use-cases.

  This change attempts to delegate any use of `preview` to `dev` failing if the command line contains positional arguments that are not compatible with `dev`.

  Resolves #9

  There was a common chunk of code across most commands that ensures a user is logged in, and retrieves an account ID. I'd resisted making this into an abstraction for a while. Now that the codebase is stable, and https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/537 removes some surrounding code there, I made an abstraction for this common code as `requireAuth()`. This gets a mention in the changelog simply because it touches a bunch of code, although it's mostly mechanical deletion/replacement.

  It is common to pass additional commands to `pages dev` to generate the input source.
  For example:

  Previously the args after `--` were being dropped.
  This change ensures that these are captured and used correctly.

  This is the first of a few changes to codify how we do environments in wrangler2, both older legacy style environments, and newer service environments.

  Currently, when creating a new project, we usually first have to create a directory before running `wrangler init`, since it defaults to creating the `wrangler.toml`, `package.json`, etc in the current working directory. This fix introduces an enhancement, where using the `wrangler init [name]` form creates a directory named `[name]` and initialises the project files inside it. This matches the usage pattern a little better, and still preserves the older behaviour when we're creating a worker inside existing projects.

  The configuration for a Worker is complicated since we can define different "environments", and each environment can have its own configuration.
  There is a default ("top-level") environment and then named environments that provide environment specific configuration.

  This is further complicated by the fact that there are three kinds of environment configuration:

  - **non-overridable**: these values are defined once in the top-level configuration, apply to all environments and cannot be overridden by an environment.
  - **inheritable**: these values can be defined at the top-level but can also be overridden by environment specific values.
    Named environments do not need to provide their own values, in which case they inherit the value from the top-level.
  - **non-inheritable**: these values must be explicitly defined in each environment if they are defined at the top-level.
    Named environments do not inherit such configuration and must provide their own values.

  All configuration values in `wrangler.toml` are optional and will receive a default value if not defined.

  This change adds more strict interfaces for top-level `Config` and `Environment` types,
  as well as validation and normalization of the optional fields that are read from `wrangler.toml`.

  We were warning if you were trying to develop a durable object with an unnamed worker. Further, the internal api would actually throw if you tried to develop with a named worker if it wasn't already published. The latter is being fixed internally and should live soon, and this fix removes the warning completely.

  During `dev` and `publish`, we should resolve `wrangler.toml` starting from the entrypoint, and then working up from there. Currently, we start from the directory from which we call `wrangler`, this changes that behaviour to start from the entrypoint instead.

  (To implement this, I made one big change: Inside commands, we now have to explicitly read configuration from a path, instead of expecting it to 'arrive' coerced into a configuration object.)

  - `--status cancelled --status error` --> you can filter on `ok`, `error`, and `cancelled` to only tail logs that have that status
  - `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER:somevalue` --> you can filter on headers, including ones that have specific values (`"somevalue"`) or just that contain any header (e.g. `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER` with no colon)
  - `--method POST --method PUT` --> filter on the HTTP method used to trigger the worker
  - `--search catch-this` --> only shows messages that contain the phrase `"catch-this"`. Does not (yet!) support regular expressions
  - `--ip self --ip 192.0.2.232` --> only show logs from requests that originate from the given IP addresses. `"self"` will be replaced with the IP address of the computer that sent the tail request.

  This formalises the logic we use to "guess"/infer what a worker's format is - either "modules" or "service worker". Previously we were using the output of the esbuild process metafile to infer this, we now explicitly do so in a separate step (esbuild's so fast that it doesn't have any apparent performance hit, but we also do a simpler form of the build to get this information).

  This also adds `--format` as a command line arg for `publish`.

  Adds support for "unsafe bindings", that is, bindings that aren't supported by wrangler, but are
  desired when uploading a Worker to Cloudflare. This allows you to use beta features before
  official support is added to wrangler, while also letting you migrate to proper support for the
  feature when desired. Note: these bindings may not work everywhere, and may break at any time.

  We open browser windows for a few things; during `wrangler dev`, and logging in. There are environments where this doesn't work as expected (like codespaces, stackblitz, etc). This fix simply logs an error instead of breaking the flow. This is the same fix as https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/263, now applied to the rest of wrangler.

  Now that we have `[[unsafe.bindings]]` (as of https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/411), we should use that for experimental features. This removes support for `[experimental_services]`, and adds a helpful message for how to rewrite their configuration.

  This error is temporary, until the internal teams that were using this rewrite their configs. We'll remove it before GA.

  What the error looks like -

  ```
  Error: The "experimental_services" field is no longer supported. Instead, use [[unsafe.bindings]] to enable experimental features. Add this to your wrangler.toml:

  [[unsafe.bindings]]
  name = "SomeService"
  type = "service"
  service = "some-service"
  environment = "staging"

  [[unsafe.bindings]]
  name = "SomeOtherService"
  type = "service"

  Previously we always published to the workers.dev subdomain, ignoring the `workers_dev` setting in the `wrangler.toml` configuration.

  Top level exception logging which will allow to Pre-empt issues, fix bugs faster,
  Identify uncommon error scenarios, and better quality error information. Context includes of Error in addition to stacktrace
  Environment:
  OS/arch
  node/npm versions
  wrangler version
  RewriteFrames relative pathing of stacktrace and will prevent user file system information
  from being sent.

  Sourcemaps:

  - The sourcemap custom scripts for path matching in Artifact, Sentry Event and Build output is moved to be handled in GH Actions
    Sentry upload moved after changeset version bump script and npm script to get current version into GH env variable
  - Add org and project to secrets for increased obfuscation of Cloudflare internal ecosystem

  Prompt for Opt-In:

  - When Error is thrown user will be prompted with yes (only sends this time), Always, and No (default). Always and No
    will be added to default.toml with a datetime property for future update checks.
  - If the property already exists it will skip the prompt.

  Sentry Tests:
  The tests currently check that the decision flow works as currently set up then checks if Sentry is able
  to send events or is disabled.

  This allows importing `.wasm` modules in service worker format workers. We do this by hijacking imports to `.wasm` modules, and instead registering them under `[wasm_modules]` (building on the work from https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/409).

  This lands support for `[wasm_modules]` as defined by https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/1677.

  wasm modules can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in wrangler.toml as -

  ```
  [wasm_modules]
  MYWASM = "./path/to/my-wasm.wasm"
  ```

  The module will then be available as the global `MYWASM` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  (In the future, we MAY enable wasm module imports in service-worker format (i.e. `import MYWASM from './path/to/my-wasm.wasm'`) and global imports inside modules format workers.)

  This change introduces three new commands, which manage buckets under the current account:

  - `r2 buckets list`: list information about all the buckets.
  - `r2 buckets create`: create a new bucket - will error if the bucket already exists.
  - `r2 buckets delete`: delete a bucket.

  This adds an error when we use an entry point that doesn't exist, either for `wrangler dev` or `wrangler publish`, and either via cli arg or `build.upload.main` in `wrangler.toml`. By using a common abstraction for `dev` and `publish`, This also adds support for using `build.config.main`/`build.config.dir` for `wrangler dev`.

  In e151223 we introduced a bug where the RouteKey was now an array rather than a simple URL string. When it got stringified into the routing object these were invalid.

  This hides `wrangler pages functions` in the main help menu, since it's only intended for internal usage right now. It still "works", so nothing changes in that regard. We'll bring this back when we have a broader story in wrangler for functions.

  The api for fetching a kv value, unlike every other cloudflare api, returns just the raw value as a string (as opposed to the `FetchResult`-style json). However, our fetch utility tries to convert every api response to json before parsing it further. This leads to bugs like https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/359. The fix is to special case for `kv:key get`.

  Previously, when we initialized a project using `wrangler init`, we always used npm as the package manager.

  - Don't rely on bash variables to configure tests
    The use of bash variables in the `npm test` script is not supported in Windows Powershell, causing CI on Windows to fail.
    These bash variables are used to override the API token and the Account ID.

    This change moves the control of mocking these two concepts into the test code, by adding `mockAccountId()` and `mockApiToken()` helpers.

    - The result is slightly more boilerplate in tests that need to avoid hitting the auth APIs.
    - But there are other tests that had to revert these environment variables. So the boilerplate is reduced there.

  - Sanitize command line for snapshot tests
    This change applies `normalizeSlashes()` and `trimTimings()` to command line outputs and error messages to avoid inconsistencies in snapshots.
    The benefit here is that authors do not need to keep adding them to all their snapshot tests.

  - Move all the helper functions into their own directory to keep the test directory cleaner.

  Previously in pages projects using advanced mode (a single `_worker.js` or `--script-path` file rather than a `./functions` folder), calling `pages dev` would quit without an error and not launch miniflare.

  There are several reasons to replace `node-fetch` with `undici`:

  - `undici`'s `fetch()` implementation is set to become node's standard `fetch()` implementation, which means we can just remove the dependency in the future (or optionally load it depending on which version of node is being used)
  - `node-fetch` pollutes the global type space with a number of standard types
  - we already bundle `undici` via `miniflare`/pages, so this means our bundle size could ostensibly become smaller.

  This replaces `node-fetch` with `undici`.

  - All instances of `import fetch from "node-fetch"` are replaced with `import {fetch} from "undici"`
  - `undici` also comes with spec compliant forms of `FormData` and `File`, so we could also remove `formdata-node` in `form_data.ts`
  - All the global types that were injected by `node-fetch` are now imported from `undici` (as well as some mistaken ones from `node:url`)
  - NOTE: this also turns on `skipLibCheck` in `tsconfig.json`. Some dependencies oddly depend on browser globals like `Request`, `Response` (like `@miniflare/core`, `jest-fetch-mock`, etc), which now fail because `node-fetch` isn't injecting those globals anymore. So we enable `skipLibCheck` to bypass them. (I'd thought `skipLibCheck` completely ignores 'third party' types, but that's not true - it still uses the module graph to scan types. So we're still typesafe. We should enable `strict` sometime to avoid `any`s, but that's for later.)
  - The bundle size isn't smaller because we're bundling 2 different versions of `undici`, but we'll fix that by separately upping the version of `undici` that miniflare bundles.

  - This adds `eslint-plugin-import` to enforce ordering of imports, and configuration for the same in `package.json`.
  - I also run `npm run check:lint -- --fix` to apply the configured order in our whole codebase.
  - This also needs a setting in `.vscode/settings.json` to prevent spurious warnings inside vscode. You'll probably have to restart your IDE for this to take effect. (re: https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2377#issuecomment-1024800026)

  (I'd also like to enforce using `node:` prefixes for node builtin modules, but that can happen later. For now I manually added the prefixes wherever they were missing. It's not functionally any different, but imo it helps the visual grouping.)

  This adds support for `*.wasm` modules into local mode for `wrangler dev`.

  In 'edge' mode, we create a javascript bundle, but wasm modules are uploaded to the preview server directly when making the worker definition form upload. However, in 'local' mode, we need to have the actual modules available to the bundle. So we copy the files over to the bundle path. We also pass appropriate `--modules-rule` directive to `miniflare`.

  I also added a sample wasm app to use for testing, created from a default `workers-rs` project.

  Previously we were caching all the `node_modules` files in the CI jobs and then running `npm install`. While this resulted in slightly improved install times on Ubuntu, it breaks on Windows because the npm workspace setup adds symlinks into node_modules, which the Github cache action cannot cope with.

  This change removes the `node_modules` caches (saving some time by not needing to restore them) and replaces `npm install` with `npm ci`.

  The `npm ci` command is actually designed to be used in CI jobs as it only installs the exact versions specified in the `package-lock.json` file, guaranteeing that for any commit we always have exactly the same CI job run, deterministically.

  It turns out that, on Ubuntu, using `npm ci` makes very little difference to the installation time (~30 secs), especially if there is no `node_modules` there in the first place.

  Unfortunately, MacOS is slower (~1 min), and Windows even worse (~2 mins)! But it is worth this longer CI run to be sure we have things working on all OSes.

  This fix passes the correct worker name to `syncAssets` during `wrangler dev`. This function uses the name to create the backing kv store for a Workers Sites definition, so it's important we get the name right.

  I also fixed the lint warning introduced in https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/321, to pass `props.enableLocalPersistence` as a dependency in the `useEffect` call that starts the "local" mode dev server.

* [#335](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/335) [`a417cb0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/a417cb0ad40708755e55bd299e282e6862aa155d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: prevent infinite loop when fetching a list of results

  When fetching a list of results from cloudflare APIs (e.g. when fetching a list of keys in a kv namespace), the api returns a `cursor` that a consumer should use to get the next 'page' of results. It appears this cursor can also be a blank string (while we'd only account for it to be `undefined`). By only accounting for it to be `undefined`, we were infinitely looping through the same page of results and never terminating. This PR fixes it by letting it be a blank string (and `null`, for good measure)

- [#332](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/332) [`a2155c1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/a2155c1ec65e271e4a5be1a19717b1aebdd647a5) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: wait for port to be available before creating a dev server

  When we run `wrangler dev`, we start a server on a port (defaulting to 8787). We do this separately for both local and edge modes. However, when switching between the two with the `l` hotkey, we don't 'wait' for the previous server to stop before starting the next one. This can crash the process, and we don't want that (of course). So we introduce a helper function `waitForPortToBeAvailable()` that waits for a port to be available before returning. This is used in both the local and edge modes, and prevents the bug right now, where switching between edge - local - edge crashes the process.

  (This isn't a complete fix, and we can still cause errors by very rapidly switching between the two modes. A proper long term fix for the future would probably be to hoist the proxy server hook above the `<Remote/>` and `<Local/>` components, and use a single instance throughout. But that requires a deeper refactor, and isn't critical at the moment.)

  We were adding text-like modules (i.e. `.txt`, `.html` and `.pem` files) as separate modules in the Worker definition, but this only really 'works' with the ES module Worker format. This commit changes that to inline the text-like files into the Worker bundle directly.

  We still have to do something similar with `.wasm` modules, but that requires a different fix, and we'll do so in a subsequent commit.

  This adds support for Workers Sites in local mode when running wrangler `dev`. Further, it fixes a bug where we were sending the `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST` definition as a separate module even with service worker format, and a bug where we weren't uploading the namespace binding when other kv namespaces weren't present.

  This PR implements `wrangler secret` for `--local` mode. The implementation is simply a no-op, since we don't want to actually write secret values to disk (I think?). I also got the messaging for remote mode right by copying from wrangler 1. Further, I added tests for all the `wrangler secret` commands.

  When we run `wrangler dev`, the session that we setup with the preview endpoint doesn't last forever, it dies after ignoring it for 5-15 minutes or so. The fix for this is to simply reconnect the server. So we use a state hook as a sigil, and add it to the dependency array of the effect that sets up the server, and simply change it every time the server closes.

  Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/197

  (In wrangler1, we used to restart the whole process, including uploading the worker again, making a new preview token, and so on. It looks like that they may not have been necessary.)

  We were using `--prefer-offline` when running `npm install` during `wrangler init`. The behaviour is odd, it doesn't seem to fetch from the remote when the cache isn't hit, which is not what I'm expecting. So we remove `--prefer-offline`.

  We were running custom builds as a regular command with `execa`. This would fail whenever we tried to run compound commands like `cargo install -q worker-build && worker-build --release` (via https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/236). The fix is to use `shell: true`, so that the command is run in a shell and can thus use bash-y syntax like `&&`, and so on. I also switched to using `execaCommand` which splits a command string into parts correctly by itself.

  BREAKING CHANGE:

  When running `dev` locally any data stored in KV, Durable Objects or the cache are no longer persisted between sessions by default.

  To turn this back on add the `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` at the command line.

  This PR adds some enhancements/fixes to the `wrangler init` command.

  - doesn't overwrite `wrangler.toml` if it already exists
  - installs `wrangler` when creating `package.json`
  - offers to install `wrangler` into `package.json` even if `package.json` already exists
  - offers to install `@cloudflare/workers-types` even if `tsconfig.json` already exists
  - pipes stdio back to the terminal so there's feedback when it's installing npm packages

  This does have the side effect of making out tests slower. I added `--prefer-offline` to the `npm install` calls to make this a shade quicker, but I can't figure out a good way of mocking these. I'll think about it some more later. We should work on making the installs themselves quicker (re: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/66)

  This PR also fixes a bug with our tests - `runWrangler` would catch thrown errors, and if we didn't manually verify the error, tests would pass. Instead, it now throws correctly, and I modified all the tests to assert on thrown errors. It seems like a lot, but it was just mechanical rewriting.

  This PR adds more special logic for some data types that get logged via `console` methods. Types like `Promise`, `Date`, `WeakMaps`, and some more, now get logged correctly (or at least, better than they used to).

  This PR also fixes a sinister bug - the `type` of the `ConsoleAPICalled` events don't match 1:1 with actual console methods (eg: `console.warn` message type is `warning`). This PR adds a mapping between those types and method names. Some methods don't seem to have a message type, I'm not sure why, but we'll get to them later.

  This adds an assertion error for making sure a `[site]` definition always has a `bucket` field.As a cleanup, I made some small fixes to the `Config` type definition, and modified the tests in `publish.test.ts` to use the config format when creating a `wrangler.toml` file.

  When we pass a non-js file as entry to esbuild, it generates a `.js` file. (which, is the whole job of esbuild, haha). So, given `<source>/index.ts`, it'll generate `<destination>/index.js`. However, when we try to 'find' the matching file to pass on as an input to creating the actual worker, we try to use the original file name inside the destination directory. At this point, the extension has changed, so it doesn't find the file, and hence we get the error that looks like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/folders/3f/fwp6mt7n13bfnkd5vl3jmh1w0000gp/T/tmp-61545-4Y5kwyNI8DGU/src/worker.ts'`

  The actual path to the destination file is actually the key of the block in `metafile.outputs` that matches the given output.entryPoint, so this PR simply rewrites the logic to use that instead.

  Any errors embedded in the response from the Cloudflare API were being lost, because `fetchInternal()` would throw on a non-200 response. This PR fixes that behaviour:

  - It doesn't throw on non-200 responses
  - It first gets the response text with `.text()` and converts it to an object with `JSON.parse`, so in case the api returns a non json response, we don't lose response we were sent.

  Unfortunately, because of the nature of this abstraction, we do lose the response `status` code and `statusText`, but maybe that's acceptable since we have richer error information in the payload. I considered logging the code and text to the terminal, but that may make it noisy.

  The `publish` command was failing when the entry-point was specified in the wrangler.toml file and the entry-point imported another file.

  This was because we were using the `metafile.inputs` to guess the entry-point file path. But the order in which the source-files were added to this object was not well defined, and so we could end up failing to find a match.

  This fix avoids this by using the fact that the `metadata.outputs` object will only contain one element that has the `entrypoint` property - and then using that as the entry-point path. For runtime safety, we now assert that there cannot be zero or multiple such elements.

  This PR cleans up the type definition for the configuration object, as well as commenting the hell out of it. There are no duplicate definitions, and I annotated what I could.

  - `@optional` means providing a value isn't mandatory
  - `@deprecated` means the field itself isn't necessary anymore in wrangler.toml
  - `@breaking` means the deprecation/optionality is a breaking change from wrangler 1
  - `@todo` means there's more work to be done (with details attached)
  - `@inherited` means the field is copied to all environments

  The description for the `kv:bulk delete` command was wrong, it was probably copied earlier from the `kv:bulk put` command. This PR fixes the mistake.

  We introduced some bugs in recent PRs

  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/196, we broke being able to pass an entrypoint directly to the cli. In this PR, I just reverted that fix. I'll reopen https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/78 and we'll tackle it again later. (cc @jgentes)
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/215, we broke being able to publish a script by just passing `--latest` or `--compatibility-data` in the cli. This PR fixes that by reading the correct argument when choosing whether to publish.
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/247, we broke how we made requests by passing headers to requests. This PR reverts the changes made in `cfetch/internal.ts`. (cc @petebacondarwin)
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/244, we broke `dev` and it would immediately crash. This PR fixes the reference in `dev.tsx` that was breaking. (cc @petebacondarwin)

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- [#231](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/231) [`18f8f65`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/18f8f65424adb8505c7584ae01b1823bb648eb6e) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - refactor: proxy/preview server

  This PR refactors how we setup the proxy server between the developer and the edge preview service during `wrangler dev`. Of note, we start the server immediately. We also buffer requests/streams and hold on to them, when starting/refreshing the token. This means a developer should never see `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error page, or have an older worker respond after making a change to the code. And when the token does get refreshed, we flush said streams/requests with the newer values, making the iteration process a lot smoother and predictable.

  This change removes all use of `any` from the code and updates the `no-explicit-any` eslint rule to be an error.

  Most API responses are JSON of the form:

  ```
  { result, success, errors, messages, result_info }
  ```

  where the `result` contains the actual response value.

  But some API responses only contain the result value.

  This change refactors the client-side fetch API to allow callers to specify what kind of response they expect.

  - A cli arg for adding a compatibility data, e.g `--compatibility_date 2022-01-05`
  - A shorthand `--latest` that sets `compatibility_date` to today's date. Usage of this flag logs a warning.
  - `latest` is NOT a config field in `wrangler.toml`.
  - In `dev`, when a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg, then we default to `--latest`.
  - In `publish` we error if a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg. Usage of `--latest` logs a warning.
  - We also accept compatibility flags via the cli, e.g: `--compatibility-flags formdata_parser_supports_files`

- [#210](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/210) [`d381fed`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/d381fed8ff6c5450d0b2ed5a636e99bb874a5a3a) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - Expose `wrangler pages functions build` command, which takes the `functions` folder and compiles it into a single Worker.

  This was already done in `wrangler pages dev`, so this change just exposes this build command for use in our build image, or for people who want to do it themselves.

* [#213](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/213) [`5e1222a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/5e1222a827792fbd4a7a48c73eedde5ffa476cf5) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - Adds support for building a Worker from a folder of functions which isn't tied to the Pages platform.

  This lets developers use the same file-based routing system an simplified syntax when developing their own Workers!

- [#199](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/199) [`d9ecb70`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/d9ecb7070ac692550497c8dfb3627e7badae4438) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Refactor inspection/debugging code -

  - I've installed devtools-protocol, a convenient package that has the static types for the devtools protocol (duh) autogenerated from chrome's devtools codebase.
  - We now log messages and exceptions into the terminal directly, so you don't have to open devtools to see those messages.
  - Messages are now buffered until a devtools instance connects, so you won't lose any messages while devtools isn't connected.
  - We don't lose the connection on making changes to the worker, removing the need for the kludgy hack on the devtools side (where we refresh the whole page when there's a change)

* [#189](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/189) [`2f7e1b2`](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/commit/2f7e1b21d229ea942bb0ee7dd46de3446576c604) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - Fix pagination handling of list requests to the Cloudflare API

  When doing a list request to the API, the server may respond with only a single page of results.
  In this case, it will also provide a `cursor` value in the `result_info` part of the response, which can be used to request the next page.
  This change implements this on the client-side so that we get all the results by requesting further pages when there is a cursor.

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 1fdcfe3: Subfolder Relative Pathing Fix issue #147
  The filename from args didn't handle relative paths passed in from users with scripts in subfolders.
  To handle the subfolder pathing a path.relative using cwd() to user input filepath to the filepath variable passed into Dev
- 0330ecf: Adds the Content-Type header when serving assets with `wrangler pages dev`. It guesses the mime-type based on the asset's file extension.
- eaf40e8: Improve the error message for bad `kv:namespace delete` commands
- 562d3ad: chore: enable eslint's no-shadow rule
- 9cef492: Adds the logic of @cloudflare/pages-functions-compiler directly into wrangler. This generates a Worker from a folder of functions.

  Also adds support for sourcemaps and automatically watching dependents to trigger a re-build.

- 3426c13: fix: prevent `useWorker`'s inifinite restarts during `dev`
- e9a1820: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.5`
- 7156e39: Pass bindings correctly to miniflare/child_process.spawn in `dev`, to prevent miniflare from erroring out on startup
- ce2d7d1: Add experimental support for worker-to-worker service bindings. This introduces a new field in configuration `experimental_services`, and serialises it when creating and uploading a worker definition. This is highly experimental, and doesn't work with `wrangler dev` yet.
- 072566f: Fixed KV getNamespaceId preview flag bug
- 5856807: Improve validation message for `kv:namespace create`

  Previously, if the user passed multiple positional arguments (which is invalid)
  the error message would suggest that these should be grouped in quotes.
  But this is also wrong, since a namespace binding name must not contain spaces.

- 34ad323: Refactor the way we convert configurations for bindings all the way through to the API where we upload a worker definition. This commit preserves the configuration structure (mostly) until the point we serialise it for the API. This prevents the way we use duck typing to detect a binding type when uploading, makes the types a bit simpler, and makes it easier to add other types of bindings in the future (notably, the upcoming service bindings.)

### Patch Changes

- 421f2e4: Update base version to 0.0.5, copy the README to packages/wrangler

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- cea27fe: don't log file contents when writing via `kv:key put <key> --path <path>`
- b53cbc8: CI/CD
  - Release flow triggered on PR's closed
- 43e7a82: When using `wrangler pages dev`, enable source maps and log unhandled rejections
- c716abc: Error and exit if the `--type` option is used for the `init` command.

  The `--type` option is no longer needed, nor supported.

  The type of a project is implicitly javascript, even if it includes a wasm (e.g. built from rust).

  Projects that would have had the `webpack` type need to be configured separately to have a custom build.

- 3752acf: Add support for websockets in `dev`, i.e. when developing workers. This replaces the proxy layer that we use to connect to the 'edge' during preview mode, using the `faye-wesocket` library.
- c7bee70: Patches typing mismatches between us, undici and miniflare when proxying requests in pages dev, and also adds fallback 404 behavior which was missed
- 8b6c2d1: Add more fields to the `tsconfig.json` generated by `wrangler init`
- 78cd080: Custom builds for `dev` and `publish`
- cd05d20: import text file types into workers
- 1216fc9: Export regular functions from dialog.ts, pass tests (followup from https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/124)
- 6fc4c50: Display error message when unknown command is provided to the wrangler CLI.
- 23543fe: Allow the developer to exit `init` if there is already a toml file
- 1df6b0c: enable @typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises, pass lint+type check
- 3c5725f: CI/CD Cleanup
  - Removed the build step from tests, which should speed up the "Tests" Workflow.
  - Added a branch specific trigger for "Release", now the Workflow for "Release" should only work on PRs closed to `main`
  - Removed the "Changeset PR" Workflow. Now the "Release" Workflow will handle everything needed for Changesets.
- fb0eae7: support importing `.wasm` files / `workers-rs` support
- e928f94: Improve support for package exports conditionals, including "worker" condition
- 43e7a82: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.4`
- f473942: Replaces the static asset server with a more faithful simulation of what happens with a production Pages project.

  Also improves error handling and automatically opens the browser when running `wrangler pages dev`.

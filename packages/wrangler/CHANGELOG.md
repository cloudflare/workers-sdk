  Updated `wrangler dev` to use a shared dev registry implementation that now powers both the Cloudflare Vite plugin and Wrangler. This internal refactoring has no user-facing changes but consolidates registry logic for better consistency across tools.

  Fix the fact that `wrangler`, when run with the `WRANGLER_LOG=DEBUG` and `WRANGLER_LOG_SANITIZE=false` environment variables, displays `{}` instead of the actual headers for requests and responses for CF API fetches

- [#10337](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/10337) [`f9f7519`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/f9f75195f8b2aa28bc297cb04e6fd4e4195a1300) Thanks [@emily-shen](https://github.com/emily-shen)! - containers: `rollout_step_percentage` now also accepts an array of numbers. Previously it accepted a single number, and each rollout step would target the same percentage of instances. Now users can customise percentages for each step.

  `rollout_step_percentage` also now defaults to `[10,100]` (previously `25`), which should make rollouts progress slightly faster.

  You can also use `wrangler deploy --containers-rollout=immediate` to override rollout settings in Wrangler configuration and update all instances in one step. Note this doesn't override `rollout_active_grace_period` if configured.

### Minor Changes

- [#10314](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/10314) [`9b09751`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/9b097518456fecee5eb0fab1f56d3a269e8bdfc5) Thanks [@dario-piotrowicz](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz)! - Show possible local vs. dashboard diff information on deploys

  When re-deploying a Worker using `wrangler deploy`, if the configuration has been modified in the Cloudflare dashboard, the local configuration will overwrite the remote one. This can lead to unexpected results for users. To address this, currently `wrangler deploy` warns users about potential configuration overrides (without presenting them) and prompts them to confirm whether they want to proceed.

  The changes here improve the above flow in the following way:

  - If the local changes only add new configurations (without modifying or removing existing ones), the deployment proceeds automatically without warnings or prompts, as these changes are non-destructive and safe.
  - If the local changes modify or remove existing configurations, `wrangler deploy` now displays a git-like diff showing the differences between the dashboard and local configurations. This allows users to review and understand the impact of their changes before confirming the deployment.

  A patched version of `debug` was previously introduced that resolved the package to a custom implementation. However, this caused issues due to CJS/ESM interop problems. We now resolve the `debug` package to use the Node.js implementation instead.

  Currently if the user has an `account_id` in their wrangler config file, such id won't be taken into consideration for the remote proxy session, the changes here make sure that it is (note that the `auth` option of `maybeStartOrUpdateRemoteProxySession`, if provided, takes precedence over this id value).

### Patch Changes

- [#10130](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/10130) [`773cca3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/773cca387b5ef01221c7a304883f8b36d1b386da) Thanks [@dario-piotrowicz](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz)! - update `maybeStartOrUpdateRemoteProxySession` config argument (to allow callers to specify an environment)

  Before this change `maybeStartOrUpdateRemoteProxySession` could be called with either the path to a wrangler config file or the configuration of a worker. The former override however did not allow the caller to specify an environment, so the `maybeStartOrUpdateRemoteProxySession` API has been updated so that in the wrangler config case an object (with the path and a potential environment) needs to be passed instead.

  For example, before callers could invoke the function in the following way

  ```ts
  await maybeStartOrUpdateRemoteProxySession(configPath);
  ```

  note that there is no way to tell the function what environment to use when parsing the wrangle configuration.

  Now callers will instead call the function in the following way:

  ```ts
  await maybeStartOrUpdateRemoteProxySession({
  	path: configPath,
  	environment: targetEnvironment,

  fix `startWorker` currently not taking into account the `auth` field
  that can be provided as part of the `dev` options when used in conjunction
  with remote bindings

  example:

  Given the following

  ```js
  import { unstable_startWorker } from "wrangler";

  const worker = await unstable_startWorker({
  	entrypoint: "./worker.js",
  	bindings: {
  		AI: {
  			type: "ai",
  			experimental_remote: true,
  		},
  	},
  	dev: {
  		experimentalRemoteBindings: true,
  		auth: {
  			accountId: "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
  			apiToken: {
  				apiToken: "<API_TOKEN>",
  			},
  		},
  	},
  });

  await worker.ready;
  ```

  `wrangler` will now use the provided `<ACCOUNT_ID>` and `<API_TOKEN>` to integrate with
  the remote AI binding instead of requiring the user to authenticate.

  currently the way `wrangler dev` prints logs is faulty, for example the following code

  ```js
  console.error("this is an error");
  console.warn("this is a warning");
  console.debug("this is a debug");
  ```

  inside a worker would cause the following logs:

  ```text
  ✘ [ERROR] this is an error

  ✘ [ERROR] this is a warning

  this is a debug
  ```

  (note that the warning is printed as an error and the debug log is printed even if by default it should not)

  the changes here make sure that the logs are instead logged to their correct level, so for the code about the following will be logged instead:

  ```text
  ✘ [ERROR] this is an error

  ▲ [WARNING] this is a warning
  ```

  (running `wrangler dev` with the `--log-level=debug` flag will also cause the debug log to be included as well)

  If there are no `.dev.vars` or `.dev.vars.<environment>` files, when running Wrangler or the Vite plugin in local development mode,
  they will now try to load additional local dev vars from `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.<environment>` and `.env.<environment>.local` files.

  These loaded vars are only for local development and have no effect in production to the vars in a deployed Worker.
  Wrangler and Vite will continue to load `.env` files in order to configure themselves as a tool.

  Further details:

  - In `vite build` the local vars will be computed and stored in a `.dev.vars` file next to the compiled Worker code, so that `vite preview` can use them.
  - The `wrangler types` command will similarly read the `.env` files (if no `.dev.vars` files) in order to generate the `Env` interface.
  - If the `CLOUDFLARE_LOAD_DEV_VARS_FROM_DOT_ENV` environment variable is `"false"` then local dev variables will not be loaded from `.env` files.
  - If the `CLOUDFLARE_INCLUDE_PROCESS_ENV` environment variable is `"true"` then all the environment variables found on `process.env` will be included as local dev vars.
  - Wrangler (but not Vite plugin) also now supports the `--env-file=<path/to/dotenv/file>` global CLI option. This affects both loading `.env` to configure Wrangler the tool as well as loading local dev vars.

  Currently, if your container engine isn't set up to listen on `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` (or isn't symlinked to that), then you have to manually set this via the `dev.containerEngine` field in your Wrangler config, or via the env vars `WRANGLER_DOCKER_HOST`. This change means that we will try and get the socket of the current context automatically. This should reduce the occurrence of opaque `internal error`s thrown by the runtime when the daemon is not listening on `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.

  In addition to `WRANGLER_DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKER_HOST` can now also be used to set the container engine socket address.

  There are two issues related to how the experimental `remoteBindings` flag is handled in `getPlatformProxy` that are being fixed by this change:

  - the `experimental_remote` configuration flag set on service bindings is incorrectly always taken into account, even if `remoteBindings` is set to `false`
  - the `experimental_remote` configuration flag of all the other bindings is never taken into account (effectively preventing the bindings to be used in remote mode) since the `remoteBindings` flag is not being properly propagated

For most developers, breakpoint debugging via VSCode is the most natural flow, but until now it's required [manually configuring a `launch.json` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/dev-tools/breakpoints/#setup-vs-code-to-use-breakpoints), running `wrangler dev`, and connecting via VSCode's built-in debugger.

  Now, using VSCode's built-in [JavaScript Debug Terminals](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_javascript-debug-terminal), there are just two steps: open a JS debug terminal and run `wrangler dev` (or `vite dev`). VSCode will automatically connect to your running Worker (even if you're running multiple Workers at once!) and start a debugging session.

  this change makes sure that that `getPlatformProxy`, when the input configuration
  file contains an assets field, correctly returns the appropriate asset binding proxy

  example:

  ```jsonc

  {
  	"name": "my-worker",
  	"assets": {
  		"directory": "./public/",
  		"binding": "ASSETS",

  console.log(text); // logs the content of file.txt

  await dispose();

  Implements the proposal noted here https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/discussions/9143.

  Now it is possible to target Wrangler at the FedRAMP High compliance region.
  There are two ways to signal to Wrangler to run in this mode:

  - set `"compliance_region": "fedramp_high"` in a Wrangler configuration
  - set `CLOUDFLARE_COMPLIANCE_REGION=fedramp_high` environment variable when running Wrangler

  If both are provided and the values do not match then Wrangler will exit with an error.

  When in this mode OAuth authentication is not supported.
  It is necessary to authenticate using a Cloudflare API Token acquired from the Cloudflare FedRAMP High dashboard.

  Most bindings and commands are supported in this mode.

  - Unsupported commands may result in API requests that are not supported - possibly 422 Unprocessable Entity responses.
  - Unsupported bindings may work in local dev, as there is no local validation, but will fail at Worker deployment time.

  In v4.15.0, Miniflare began stripping the `CF-Connecting-IP` header via a global outbound service, which led to a TCP connection regression due to a bug in Workerd.

Previously, running `wrangler types` with a config including a service binding would generate an `Env` type like this:

  ```ts
  interface Env {
  	SERVICE_BINDING: Fetcher;
  }
  ```

  This type was "correct", but didn't capture the possibility of using JSRPC to communicate with the service binding. Now, running `wrangler types -c wrangler.json -c ../service/wrangler.json` (the first config representing the current Worker, and any additional configs representing service bound Workers) will generate an `Env` type like this:

  ```ts
  interface Env {
  	SERVICE_BINDING: Service<import("../service/src/index").Entrypoint>;
  }
  ```

  Previously, if you added modules rules such as `**/*.js` or `**/*.json`, specified `no_bundle: true`, and the entry-point to the Worker was in the project root directory, Wrangler could include files that were not intended, such as `.wrangler/tmp/xxx.js` or the Wrangler config file itself.

  In your configuration file, you can define a service binding with props:

  ```json
  {
  	"services": [
  		{
  			"binding": "MY_SERVICE",
  			"service": "some-worker",
  			"props": { "foo": 123, "bar": "value" }
  		}
  	]

  These can then be accessed by the callee:

  ```ts
  import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

  export default class extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  	fetch() {
  		return new Response(JSON.stringify(this.ctx.props));

  Adds a new option to Wrangler to allow developers to opt out of esbuild's `keep_names` option (https://esbuild.github.io/api/#keep-names). By default, Wrangler sets this to `true`

  This is something developers should not usually need to care about, but sometimes
  `keep_names` can create issues, and in such cases they will be now able to opt-out.

  Example `wrangler.jsonc`:

  ```json
  {
  	"name": "my-worker",
  	"main": "src/worker.ts",
  	"keep_names": false
  }
  ```

  a validation check has recently been introduced to make wrangler error on
  deploy commands when an environment is specified and a redirected configuration
  is in use (the reason being that redirected configurations should not include
  any environment), this check is problematic with pages commands where the
  "production" environment is anyways set by default, to address this the validation
  check is being relaxed here on pages commands

  add the following validation behaviors to wrangler deploy commands, that relate
  to redirected configs (i.e. config files specified by `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` files):

  - redirected configs are supposed to be already flattened configurations without any
    environment (i.e. a build tool should generate redirected configs already targeting specific
    environments), so if wrangler encounters a redirected config with some environments defined
    it should error
  - given the point above, specifying an environment (`--env=my-env`) when using redirected
    configs is incorrect, so these environments should be ignored and a warning should be
    presented to the user

  This change removes `wrangler d1 backups`, a set of alpha-only commands that would allow folks to interact with backups of their D1 alpha DBs.

  This patch updates esbuild from 0.17.19 to 0.24.2. That's a big bump! Lots has gone into esbuild since May '23. All the details are available at https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md / https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/main/CHANGELOG-2023.md.

  - We now support all modern JavasScript/TypeScript features suported by esbuild (as of December 2024). New additions include standard decorators, auto-accessors, and the `using` syntax.
  - 0.18 introduced wider support for configuration specified via `tsconfig.json` https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3019. After observing the (lack of) any actual broken code over the last year for this release, we feel comfortable releasing this without considering it a breaking change.
  - 0.19.3 introduced support for import attributes

    ```js
    import stuff from './stuff.json' with { type: 'json' }
    ```

    While we don't currently expose the esbuild configuration for developers to add their own plugins to customise how modules with import attributes are bundled, we may introduce new "types" ourselves in the future.

  - 0.19.0 introduced support for wildcard imports. Specifics here (https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/main/CHANGELOG-2023.md#0190). tl;dr -

    - These 2 patterns will bundle all files that match the glob pattern into a single file.

      ```js
      const json1 = await import("./data/" + kind + ".json");
      ```

      ```js
      const json2 = await import(`./data/${kind}.json`);
      ```

    - This pattern will NOT bundle any matching patterns:
      ```js
      const path = "./data/" + kind + ".js";
      const json2 = await import(path);
      ```
      You can use `find_additional_modules` to bundle any additional modules that are not referenced in the code but are required by the project.

    Now, this MAY be a breaking change for some. Specifically, if you were previously using the pattern (that will now include all files matching the glob pattern in the bundle), BUT `find_additional_modules` was NOT configured to include some files, those files would now be included in the bundle. For example, consider this code:

    ```js
    // src/index.js
    export default {
    	async fetch() {
    		const url = new URL(request.url);
    		const name = url.pathname;
    		const value = (await import("." + name)).default;
    		return new Response(value);
    	},
    };
    ```

    Imagine if in that folder, you had these 3 files:

    ```js
    // src/one.js
    export default "one";
    ```

    ```js
    // src/two.js
    export default "two";
    ```

    ```js
    // src/hidden/secret.js
    export default "do not share this secret";
    ```

    And your `wrangler.toml` was:

    ```toml
    name = "my-worker"
    main = "src/index.js
    ```

    Before this update:

    1. A request to anything but `http://localhost:8787/` would error. For example, a request to `http://localhost:8787/one.js` would error with _No such module "one.js"._
    2. Let's configure `wrangler.toml` to include all `.js` files in the `src` folder:

    ```toml
    name = "my-worker"
    main = "src/index.js

    find_additional_modules = true
    rules = [
      { type = "ESModule", globs = ["*.js"]}
    ]
    ```

    Now, a request to `http://localhost:8787/one.js` would return the contents of `src/one.js`, but a request to `http://localhost:8787/hidden/secret.js` would error with _No such module "hidden/secret.js"._ To include this file, you could expand the `rules` array to be:

    ```toml
    rules = [
      { type = "ESModule", globs = ["**/*.js"]}
    ]
    ```

    Then, a request to `http://localhost:8787/hidden/secret.js` will return the contents of `src/hidden/secret.js`.

    After this update:

    - Let's put the wrangler.toml back to its original configuration:

    ```toml
    name = "my-worker"
    main = "src/index.js
    ```

    - Now, a request to `http://localhost:8787/one.js` will return the contents of `src/one.js`, but a request to `http://localhost:8787/hidden/secret.js` will ALSO return the contents of `src/hidden/secret.js`. THIS MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT. You can "fix" this in 2 ways:

      1. Remove the inline wildcard import:

      ```js
      // src/index.js
      export default {
      	async fetch() {
      		const name = new URL(request.url).pathname;
      		const moduleName = "./" + name;
      		const value = (await import(moduleName)).default;
      		return new Response(value);
      	},
      };
      ```

      Now, no extra modules are included in the bundle, and a request to `http://localhost:8787/hidden/secret.js` will throw an error. You can use the `find_additional_modules` feature to include it again.

      2. Don't use the wildcard import pattern:

      ```js
      // src/index.js
      import one from "./one.js";
      import two from "./two.js";

      export default {
      	async fetch() {
      		const name = new URL(request.url).pathname;
      		switch (name) {
      			case "/one.js":
      				return new Response(one);
      			case "/two.js":
      				return new Response(two);
      			default:
      				return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
      		}
      	},
      };
      ```

      Further, there may be some files that aren't modules (js/ts/wasm/text/binary/etc) that are in the folder being included (For example, a `photo.jpg` file). This pattern will now attempt to include them in the bundle, and throw an error. It will look like this:

      `[ERROR] No loader is configured for ".png" files: src/photo.jpg`

      To fix this, simply move the offending file to a different folder.

      In general, we DO NOT recommend using the wildcard import pattern. If done wrong, it can leak files into your bundle that you don't want, or make your worker slightly slower to start. If you must use it (either with a wildcard import pattern or with `find_additional_modules`) you must be diligent to check that your worker is working as expected and that you are not leaking files into your bundle that you don't want. You can configure eslint to disallow dynamic imports like this:

      ```js
      // eslint.config.js
      export default [
      	{
      		rules: {
      			"no-restricted-syntax": [
      				"error",
      				{
      					selector: "ImportExpression[argument.type!='Literal']",
      					message:
      						"Dynamic imports with non-literal arguments are not allowed.",
      				},
      			],
      		},
      	},
      ];
      ```

  When running `wrangler kv namespace create <name>`, previously the name of the namespace was automatically prefixed with the worker title, or `worker-` when running outside the context of a worker.
  After this change, KV namespaces will no longer get prefixed, and the name used is the name supplied, verbatim.

  `wrangler types` will now produce one file that contains both `Env` types and runtime types based on your compatibility date and flags. This is located at `worker-configuration.d.ts` by default.

  This behaviour was previously gated behind `--experimental-include-runtime`. That flag is no longer necessary and has been removed. It has been replaced by `--include-runtime` and `--include-env`, both of which are set to `true` by default. If you were previously using `--x-include-runtime`, you can drop that flag and remove the separate `runtime.d.ts` file.

  If you were previously using `@cloudflare/workers-types` we recommend you run uninstall (e.g. `npm uninstall @cloudflare/workers-types`) and run `wrangler types` instead. Note that `@cloudflare/workers-types` will continue to be published.

  If a generated types file is found at the default output location of `wrangler types` (`worker-configuration.d.ts`), remind users to rerun `wrangler types` if it looks like they're out of date.

  The bulk put api has an optional "base64" boolean property for each key.
  Before storing the key, the value should be decoded from base64.

  For real (remote) kv, this is handled by the rest api. For local kv, it
  seems the base64 field was ignored, meaning encoded base64 content was
  stored locally rather than the raw values.

  To fix, we need to decode each value before putting to the local
  miniflare namespace when base64 is true.

  This can be imported into Chrome DevTools or opened directly in VSCode to view a flamegraph of your Worker's startup phase. Additionally, when a Worker deployment fails with a startup time error Wrangler will automatically generate a CPU profile for easy investigation.

  Advanced usage:

  - `--args`: to customise the way `wrangler check startup` builds your Worker for analysis, provide the exact arguments you use when deploying your Worker with `wrangler deploy`. For instance, if you deploy your Worker with `wrangler deploy --no-bundle`, you should use `wrangler check startup --args="--no-bundle"` to profile the startup phase.
  - `--worker-bundle`: if you don't use Wrangler to deploy your Worker, you can use this argument to provide a Worker bundle to analyse. This should be a file path to a serialised multipart upload, with the exact same format as the API expects: https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workers/subresources/scripts/methods/update/

  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/7251 added support for running multiple Workers in one `wrangler dev`/miniflare session. e.g. `wrangler dev -c wrangler.toml -c ../worker2/wrangler.toml`, which among other things, allowed cross-service RPC to Durable Objects.

  However this did not work in the same way as production when there was a Worker with assets - this PR should fix that.

  this log only appears once

To try it out, pass multiple `-c` flags to Wrangler: i.e. `wrangler pages dev -c wrangler.toml -c ../other-worker/wrangler.toml`.

  this change makes sure that that `getPlatformProxy`, when the input configuration

- [#5086](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5086) [`8faf2c0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/8faf2c07415030a3c8d9e5fc0e122a59141b3786) Thanks [@dario-piotrowicz](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz)! - add `--strict-vars` option to `wrangler types`

  add a new `--strict-vars` option to `wrangler types` that developers can (by setting the
  flag to `false`) use to disable the default strict/literal types generation for their variables

  opting out of strict variables can be useful when developers change often their `vars` values,
  even more so when multiple environments are involved

  ## Example

  With a toml containing:

  ```toml
  [vars]
  MY_VARIABLE = "production_value"
  MY_NUMBERS = [1, 2, 3]

  [env.staging.vars]
  MY_VARIABLE = "staging_value"
  MY_NUMBERS = [7, 8, 9]
  ```

  the `wrangler types` command would generate the following interface:

  ```
  interface Env {
          MY_VARIABLE: "production_value" | "staging_value";
          MY_NUMBERS: [1,2,3] | [7,8,9];
  }
  ```

  while `wrangler types --strict-vars=false` would instead generate:

  ```
  interface Env {
          MY_VARIABLE: string;
          MY_NUMBERS: number[];
  }
  ```

  (allowing the developer to easily change their toml variables without the
  risk of breaking typescript types)

  Currently, the type generated for `vars` is a string literal consisting of the value of the variable in the top level environment. If multiple environments
  are specified this wrongly restricts the type, since the variable could contain any of the values from each of the environments.

  For example, given a `wrangler.toml` containing the following:

  ```
  [vars]
  MY_VAR = "dev value"

  [env.production.vars]
  MY_VAR = "prod value"
  ```

  running `wrangler types` would generate:

  ```ts
  interface Env {
  	MY_VAR: "dev value";
  }
  ```

  making typescript incorrectly assume that `MY_VAR` is always going to be `"dev value"`

  after these changes, the generated interface would instead be:

  ```ts
  interface Env {
  	MY_VAR: "dev value" | "prod value";
  }
  ```

- [#7442](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/7442) [`e4716cc`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/e4716cc87893a0633bd2d00543b351e83e228970) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - feat: add support for redirecting Wrangler to a generated config when running deploy-related commands

  This new feature is designed for build tools and frameworks to provide a deploy-specific configuration,
  which Wrangler can use instead of user configuration when running deploy-related commands.
  It is not expected that developers of Workers will need to use this feature directly.

  ### Affected commands

  The commands that use this feature are:

  - `wrangler deploy`
  - `wrangler dev`
  - `wrangler versions upload`
  - `wrangler versions deploy`
  - `wrangler pages deploy`
  - `wrangler pages build`
  - `wrangler pages build-env`

  ### Config redirect file

  When running these commands, Wrangler will look up the directory tree from the current working directory for a file at the path `.wrangler/deploy/config.json`. This file must contain only a single JSON object of the form:

  ```json
  { "configPath": "../../path/to/wrangler.json" }
  ```

  When this file exists Wrangler will follow the `configPath` (relative to the `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` file) to find an alternative Wrangler configuration file to load and use as part of this command.

  When this happens Wrangler will display a warning to the user to indicate that the configuration has been redirected to a different file than the user's configuration file.

  ### Custom build tool example

  A common approach that a build tool might choose to implement.

  - The user writes code that uses Cloudflare Workers resources, configured via a user `wrangler.toml` file.

    ```toml
    name = "my-worker"
    main = "src/index.ts"
    [[kv_namespaces]]
    binding = "<BINDING_NAME1>"
    id = "<NAMESPACE_ID1>"
    ```

    Note that this configuration points `main` at user code entry-point.

  - The user runs a custom build, which might read the `wrangler.toml` to find the entry-point:

    ```bash
    > my-tool build
    ```

  - This tool generates a `dist` directory that contains both compiled code and a new deployment configuration file, but also a `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` file that redirects Wrangler to this new deployment configuration file:

    ```plain
    - dist
      - index.js
    	- wrangler.json
    - .wrangler
      - deploy
    	  - config.json
    ```

    The `dist/wrangler.json` will contain:

    ```json
    {
    	"name": "my-worker",
    	"main": "./index.js",
    	"kv_namespaces": [
    		{ "binding": "<BINDING_NAME1>", "id": "<NAMESPACE_ID1>" }
    	]
    }
    ```

    And the `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` will contain:

    ```json
    {
    	"configPath": "../../dist/wrangler.json"
    }
    ```

  By default wrangler uses the bundled unenv preset.

  Setting `WRANGLER_UNENV_RESOLVE_PATHS` allow to use another version of the preset.
  Those paths are used when resolving the unenv module identifiers to absolute paths.
  This can be used to test a development version.

  We want to measure accurately what this number of Workers + Assets projects running in remote mode is, as this number will be a very helpful data point down the road, when more decisions around remote mode will have to be taken.

  These changes add this kind of insight to our telemetry data, by capturing whether the command running is in the context of a Workers + Assets project.

  N.B. With these changes in place we will be capturing the Workers + Assets context for all commands, not just wrangler dev --remote.

  Workers + Assets projects have, in certain situations, a relatively degraded `wrangler dev --remote` developer experience, as opposed to Workers proper projects. This is due to the fact that, for Workers + Assets, we need to make extra API calls to:

  1. check for asset files changes
  2. upload the changed assets, if any

  This commit improves the `wrangler dev --remote` DX for Workers + Assets, for use cases when the User Worker/assets change while the API calls for previous changes are still in flight. For such use cases, we have put an exit early strategy in place, that drops the event handler execution of the previous changes, in favour of the handler triggered by the new changes.

  It is an error for the the user to provide an environment name that doesn't match any of the named environments in the Wrangler configuration.
  But if there are no named environments defined at all in the Wrangler configuration, we special case the top-level environment as though it was a named environment.
  Previously, when this happens, we would remove all the nonInheritable fields from the configuration (essentially all the bindings) leaving an incorrect configuration.
  Now we correctly generate a flattened named environment that has the nonInheritable fields, plus correctly applies any transformFn on inheritable fields.

To try it out, pass multiple `-c` flags to Wrangler: i.e. `wrangler dev -c wrangler.toml -c ../other-worker/wrangler.toml`. The first config will be treated as the _primary_ worker and will be exposed over HTTP as usual (localhost:8787) while the rest will be treated as _secondary_ and will only be accessible via a service binding from the primary worker. Notably, these workers all run in the same runtime instance, which should improve reliability of multiworker dev and fix some bugs (RPC to cross worker Durable Objects, for instance).

  Wrangler now supports both JSON (`wrangler.json`) and TOML (`wrangler.toml`) for it's configuration file. The format of Wrangler's configuration file is exactly the same across both languages, except that the syntax is `JSON` rather than `TOML`. e.g.

  ```toml
  name = "worker-ts"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2023-05-04"
  ```

  would be interpreted the same as the equivalent JSON

  ```json

  The current Preview URLs (beta) feature routes to version preview urls based on the status of the `workers_dev` config value. Beta users have requested the ability to enable deployment urls and preview urls separately on `workers.dev`, and the new `previews_enabled` field of the enable-subdomain API will allow that. This change separates the `workers_dev` and `preview_urls` behavior during `wrangler triggers deploy` and `wrangler versions upload`. `preview_urls` defaults to true, and does not implicitly depend on routes the way `workers_dev` does.

  A common mistake is to forget to export from the entry-point of a Worker, which causes
  Wrangler to infer that we are in "Service Worker" mode.

  In this mode, imports to external modules are not allowed.
  Currently this only fails at runtime, because our esbuild step converts these imports to an internal `__require()` call that throws an error.
  The error message is misleading and does not help the user identify the cause of the problem.
  This is particularly tricky where the external imports are added by a library or our own node.js polyfills.

This creates a new binding that allows sending events to
  the specified pipeline.

  Example:

  [[pipelines]]
  binding = "MY_PIPELINE"
  pipeline = "my-pipeline"

- [#6668](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6668) [`88c40be`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/88c40bec9b32ae1a6bcc2f41427ba5958cb3ae63) Thanks [@zebp](https://github.com/zebp)! - feature: add observability setting to wrangler.toml

  Adds the `observability` setting which provides your Worker with automatic persistent logs that can be searched, filtered, and queried directly from the Workers dashboard.

- [#6679](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6679) [`2174127`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/21741277a5bcd6fe6a3f531c8cacc34df84d287e) Thanks [@jkoe-cf](https://github.com/jkoe-cf)! - feat: adding option to specify a rule within the config to delete (if no rules are specified, all rules get deleted)

  This adds "support" for analytics engine datasets for `wrangler dev`. Specifically, it simply mocks the AE bindings so that they exist while developing (and don't throw when accessed).

  This does NOT add support in Pages, though we very well could do so in a similar way in a followup.

  This file can be added to the root of the assets directory that is to be uploaded alongside the Worker
  when using `experimental_assets`.

  The file follows the `.gitignore` syntax, and any matching paths will not be included in the upload.

  We want wrangler to error if users are trying to deploy a Worker with assets, and routes with a path component.

  All Workers with assets must have either:

  - custom domain routes
  - pattern routes which have no path component (except for the wildcard splat) "some.domain.com/\*"

  Cloudflare Pipelines is a product that handles the ingest of event streams
  into R2. This feature integrates various forms of managing pipelines.

  Usage:
  `wrangler pipelines create <pipeline>`: Create a new pipeline
  `wrangler pipelines list`: List current pipelines
  `wrangler pipelines show <pipeline>`: Show a pipeline configuration
  `wrangler pipelines update <pipeline>`: Update a pipeline
  `wrangler pipelines delete <pipeline>`: Delete a pipeline

  Examples:
  wrangler pipelines create my-pipeline --r2 MY_BUCKET --access-key-id "my-key" --secret-access-key "my-secret"
  wrangler pipelines show my-pipeline
  wrangler pipelines delete my-pipline

  example:

  ```toml
  # wrangler.toml
  [[hyperdrive]]
  binding = "MY_HYPERDRIVE"
  id = "000000000000000000000000000000000"
  localConnectionString = "postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1234/db"
  ```

  ```js
  // index.mjs

  import postgres from "postgres";
  import { getPlatformProxy } from "wrangler";

  const { env, dispose } = await getPlatformProxy();

  try {
  	const sql = postgres(
  		// Note: connectionString points to `postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1234/db` not to the actual hyperdrive
  		//       connection string, for more details see the explanation below
  		env.MY_HYPERDRIVE.connectionString
  	);
  	const results = await sql`SELECT * FROM pg_tables`;
  	await sql.end();
  } catch (e) {
  	console.error(e);
  }

  await dispose();
  ```

  Note: the returned binding values are no-op/passthrough that can be used inside node.js, meaning
  that besides direct connections via the `connect` methods, all the other values point to the
  same db connection specified in the user configuration

  The version upload API returns a field indicating whether
  a preview exists for that version. If a preview exists and
  workers.dev is enabled, wrangler will now log the full
  URL on version upload.

  This does not impact wrangler deploy, which only prints the
  workers.dev route of the latest deployment.

### Patch Changes

- [#6615](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6615) [`21a09e0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/21a09e06473e28722c3fe73dee9cd49b41807be3) Thanks [@RamIdeas](https://github.com/RamIdeas)! - chore: avoid potential double-install of create-cloudflare

  When `wrangler init` delegates to C3, it did so via `npm create cloudflare@2.5.0`. C3's v2.5.0 was the first to include auto-update support to avoid `npx`'s potentially stale cache. But this also guaranteed a double install for users who do not have 2.5.0 cached. Now, wrangler delegates via `npm create cloudflare@^2.5.0` which should use the latest version cached on the user's system or install and use the latest v2.x.x.

- [#6603](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6603) [`a197460`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/a197460f47db47279f2c5536269cd0de2b543576) Thanks [@taylorlee](https://github.com/taylorlee)! - chore: fix version upload log order

  Previously deploy prints:
  upload timings
  deploy timings
  current version id

  while version upload prints:
  worker version id
  upload timings

  This change makes version upload more similar to deploy by printing
  version id after upload, which also makes more sense, as version ID can
  only be known after upload has finished.

  These are now available to use without the --x-versions flag, you can continue to pass this however without issue to keep compatibility with all the usage today.

  A few of the commands had an output that wasn't guarded by `--x-versions` those have been updated to use the newer output, we have tried to keep compatibility where possible (for example: `wrangler rollback` will continue to output "Worker Version ID:" so users can continue to grab the ID).
  If you wish to use the old versions of the commands you can pass the `--no-x-versions` flag. Note, these will be removed in the future so please work on migrating.

  This should have zero user-facing impact but sets up the most used command to deploy Workers to use the new recommended APIs and move away from the old ones.
  We will still call the old upload path where required (e.g. Durable Object migration or Service Worker format).

  These changes do the ground work needed in order to add Assets support for Workers in `wrangler dev`. They implement the following:

  - it creates a new package called `workers-shared` that hosts the `Asset Server Worker`, and the `Router Worker`in the future
  - it scaffolds the `Asset Server Worker` in some very basic form, with basic configuration. Further behaviour implementation will follow in a subsequent PR
  - it does the ground work of plumbing ASW into Miniflare

  This commit adds support for `wrangler.jsonc` config file for Workers. This feature is available behind the `--experimental-json-config` flag (just like `wrangler.json`).

  To use the new configuration file, add a `wrangler.jsonc` file to your Worker project and run `wrangler dev --experimental-json-config` or `wrangler deploy --experimental-json-config`.

  It is easy to get confused when trying to logout while the CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN env var is set.

  The watch mode in `pages dev` for Advanced Mode projects is currently partially broken, as it only watches for changes in the "\_worker.js" file, but not for changes in any of its imported dependencies. This means that given the following "\_worker.js" file

  ```
  import { graham } from "./graham-the-dog";
  export default {
  	fetch(request, env) {
  		return new Response(graham)
  	}
  }
  ```

  `pages dev` will reload for any changes in the `_worker.js` file itself, but not for any changes in `graham-the-dog.js`, which is its dependency.

  Similarly, `pages dev` will not reload for any changes in non-JS module imports, such as wasm/html/binary module imports.

  This commit fixes all the aforementioned issues.

### Minor Changes

- [#6167](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6167) [`e048958`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/e048958778bf8c43a0a23c0f555c1538acc32f09) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feature: alias modules in the worker

  Sometimes, users want to replace modules with other modules. This commonly happens inside a third party dependency itself. As an example, a user might have imported `node-fetch`, which will probably never work in workerd. You can use the alias config to replace any of these imports with a module of your choice.

  Let's say you make a `fetch-nolyfill.js`

  ```ts
  export default fetch; // all this does is export the standard fetch function`
  ```

  You can then configure `wrangler.toml` like so:

  ```toml
  # ...
  [alias]
  "node-fetch": "./fetch-nolyfill"
  ```

  So any calls to `import fetch from 'node-fetch';` will simply use our nolyfilled version.

  You can also pass aliases in the cli (for both `dev` and `deploy`). Like:

  ```bash
  npx wrangler dev --alias node-fetch:./fetch-nolyfill
  ```

  The watch mode in `pages dev` for Pages Functions projects is currently partially broken, as it only watches for file system changes in the
  "/functions" directory, but not for changes in any of the Functions' dependencies. This means that given a Pages Function `math-is-fun.ts`, defined as follows:

  ```
  import { ADD } from "../math/add";

  export async function onRequest() {
  	return new Response(`${ADD} is fun!`);
  }
  ```

  `pages dev` will reload for any changes in `math-is-fun.ts` itself, but not for any changes in `math/add.ts`, which is its dependency.

  Similarly, `pages dev` will not reload for any changes in non-JS module imports, such as wasm/html/binary module imports.

  This commit fixes all these things, plus adds some extra polish to the `pages dev` watch mode experience.

  `wrangler versions secret put` allows for you to add/update a secret even if the latest version is not fully deployed. A new version with this secret will be created, the existing secrets and config are copied from the latest version.

  `wrangler versions secret bulk` allows you to bulk add/update multiple secrets at once, this behaves the same as `secret put` and will only make one new version.

  `wrangler versions secret list` lists the secrets available to the currently deployed versions. `wrangler versions secret list --latest-version` or `wrangler secret list` will list for the latest version.

  Additionally, we will now prompt for extra confirmation if attempting to rollback to a version with different secrets than the currently deployed.

  This patch cleans up warnings we were seeing when doing a full build. Specifically:

  - fixtures/remix-pages-app had a bunch of warnings about impending features that it should be upgraded to, so I did that. (tbh this one needs a full upgrade of packages, but we'll get to that later when we're upgrading across the codebase)
  - updated `@microsoft/api-extractor` so it didn't complain that it didn't match the `typescript` version (that we'd recently upgraded)
  - it also silenced a bunch of warnings when exporting types from `wrangler`. We'll need to fix those, but we'll do that when we work on unstable_dev etc.
  - workers-playground was complaining about the size of the bundle being generated, so I increased the limit on it

- [#6043](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/6043) [`db66101`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/db661015d37ce75c021413e3ca7c4f0488790cbc) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: avoid esbuild warning when running dev/bundle

  I've been experimenting with esbuild 0.21.4 with wrangler. It's mostly been fine. But I get this warning every time

  ```
  ▲ [WARNING] Import "__INJECT_FOR_TESTING_WRANGLER_MIDDLEWARE__" will always be undefined because there is no matching export in "src/index.ts" [import-is-undefined]

      .wrangler/tmp/bundle-Z3YXTd/middleware-insertion-facade.js:8:23:
        8 │ .....(OTHER_EXPORTS.__INJECT_FOR_TESTING_WRANGLER_MIDDLEWARE__ ?? []),
          ╵
  ```

  This is because esbuild@0.18.5 enabled a warning by default whenever an undefined import is accessed on an imports object. However we abuse imports to inject stuff in `middleware.test.ts`. A simple fix is to only inject that code in tests.

- [#5878](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5878) [`1e68fe5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/1e68fe5448ffa4d0551dc7255405983c329235c8) Thanks [@IgorMinar](https://github.com/IgorMinar)! - feat: add experimental support for hybrid Node.js compatibility

  _This feature is experimental and not yet available for general consumption._

  Use a combination of workerd Node.js builtins (behind the `experimental:nodejs_compat_v2` flag) and
  Unenv polyfills (configured to only add those missing from the runtime) to provide a new more effective
  Node.js compatibility approach.

  The old command is now deprecated (but still functional) and will be removed in a future release. The new command is now more consistent with the rest of the wrangler CLI commands.

- [#5989](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5989) [`35b1a2f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/35b1a2f59bf0849e65782a278463cd0c3d294817) Thanks [@RamIdeas](https://github.com/RamIdeas)! - feature: rename `wrangler kv:...` commands to `wrangler kv ...`

  The old commands are now deprecated (but still functional) and will be removed in a future release. The new commands are now more consistent with the rest of the wrangler CLI commands.

  Pages projects can now upload sourcemaps for server bundles to enable remapped stacktraces in realtime logs when deployed with `upload_source_map` set to `true` in `wrangler.toml`.

There should be no observable behaviour changes when this flag is enabled.

  This work includes a series of improvements to the `pages dev` terminal output, in an attempt to make this output more structured, organised, cleaner, easier to follow, and therefore more helpful for our users <3

- [#5960](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5960) [`e648825`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/e6488257f9376d415d970b045d77f0223d2f7884) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - fix: avoid injecting esbuild watch stubs into production Worker code

  When we added the ability to include additional modules in the deployed bundle of a Worker,
  we inadvertently also included some boiler plate code that is only needed at development time.

  This fix ensures that this code is only injected if we are running esbuild in watch mode
  (e.g. `wrangler dev`) and not when building for deployment.

  It is interesting to note that this boilerplate only gets included in the production code
  if there is an import of CommonJS code in the Worker, which esbuild needs to convert to an
  ESM import.

This allows someone targetting staging to have their staging auth details saved separately from production, this saves them logging in and out when switching environments.

### Patch Changes

- [#5938](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5938) [`9e4d8bc`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/9e4d8bcb8811b9dc2570de26660baa4361a52749) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: let "assets" in wrangler.toml be a string

  The experimental "assets" field can be either a string or an object. However the type definition marks it only as an object. This is a problem because we use this to generate the json schema, which gets picked up by vscode's even better toml extension, and shows it to be an error when used with a string (even though it works fine). The fix is to simply change the type definition to add a string variant.

  If a Pages project fails to deploy, `wrangler pages deploy` will log
  an error message, but exit successfully. It should instead throw a
  `FatalError`.

  Today, if uploading a Pages Function, or deploying a Pages project fails for whatever reason, there’s no feedback shown to the user. Worse yet, the shown message is misleading, saying the deployment was successful, when in fact it was not:

  ```
  ✨ Deployment complete!
  ```

  This commit ensures that we provide users with:

  - the correct feedback with respect to their Pages deployment
  - the appropriate messaging depending on the status of their project's deployment status
  - the appropriate logs in case of a deployment failure

- [#5814](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5814) [`2869e03`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/2869e0379667d755d1de5543cb80886cc42c211f) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - fix: Display correct global flags in `wrangler pages --help`

  Running `wrangler pages --help` will list, amongst others, the following global flags:

  ```
  -j, --experimental-json-config
  -c, --config
  -e, --env
  -h, --help
  -v, --version
  ```

  This is not accurate, since flags such as `--config`, `--experimental-json-config`, or `env` are not supported by Pages.

  This commit ensures we display the correct global flags that apply to Pages.

  If you're currently using the old binding, please move over to the new version_metadata binding by adding:

  ```toml
  [version_metadata]
  binding = "CF_VERSION_METADATA"
  ```

  and updating your usage accordingly. You can find the docs for the new binding here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/version-metadata

  Prior to Wrangler 3.4.0 we displayed an error if the user tried to upload a
  JSON file that contained non-string secrets, since these are not supported
  by the Cloudflare backend.

  This change reintroduces that check to give the user a helpful error message
  rather than a cryptic `workers.api.error.invalid_script_config` error code.

  This could be observed as the browser loading indefinitely, after saving a source file (unchanged) when using custom builds. This is now fixed by ensuring the proxy server is unpaused after a short timeout period.

  A regression was introduced in wrangler 3.46.0 (https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5215)
  which made it so that missing `Request#cf` properties are serialized as `"undefined"`, this in turn
  throws a syntax parse error when such values are parsed via `JSON.parse` breaking the communication
  with Durable Object local proxies. Fix such issue by serializing missing `Request#cf` properties as
  `"{}"` instead.

  The current version of the kv:key put command with the --path argument will treat file contents as a string because it is not one of Blob or File when passed to the form helper library. We should turn it into a Blob so it's not mangling inputs.

Wrangler allows you to interact with storage classes once it is

  changing the default storage class of a bucket, and uploading an object.

  ```bash

  wrangler r2 bucket update storage-class my-bucket -s InfrequentAccess

  Adds the `source_maps` boolean config option. When enabled, source maps included in the build output are uploaded alongside the built code modules. Uploaded source maps can then be used to remap stack traces emitted by the Workers runtime.

  This change allows service bindings to bind to a named export of another Worker. As an example, consider the following Worker named `bound`:

  ```ts
  import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";

  export class EntrypointA extends WorkerEntrypoint {
  	fetch(request) {
  		return new Response("Hello from entrypoint A!");
  	}
  }

  export const entrypointB: ExportedHandler = {
  	fetch(request, env, ctx) {
  		return new Response("Hello from entrypoint B!");
  	},
  };

  export default <ExportedHandler>{
  	fetch(request, env, ctx) {
  		return new Response("Hello from the default entrypoint!");
  	},
  };
  ```

  Up until now, you could only bind to the `default` entrypoint. With this change, you can bind to `EntrypointA` or `entrypointB` too using the new `entrypoint` option:

  ```toml
  [[services]]
  binding = "SERVICE"
  service = "bound"
  entrypoint = "EntrypointA"
  ```

  To bind to named entrypoints with `wrangler pages dev`, use the `#` character:

  ```shell
  $ wrangler pages dev --service=SERVICE=bound#EntrypointA
  ```

  Previously, to get the correct Workers AI API, you needed to wrap your `env.AI` binding with `new Ai()` from `@cloudflare/ai`. This change moves the contents of `@cloudflare/ai` into the Workers runtime itself, meaning `env.AI` is now an instance of `Ai`, without the need for wrapping.

  This command currently requires the `--experimental-versions` flag.

  This command extracts the trigger deployment logic from `wrangler deploy` and allows users to update their currently deployed Worker's triggers without doing another deployment. This is primarily useful for users of `wrangler versions upload` and `wrangler versions deploy` who can then run `wrangler triggers deploy` to apply trigger changes to their currently deployed Worker Versions.

  The command can also be used even if not using the `wrangler versions ...` commands. And, in fact, users are already using it implicitly when running `wrangler deploy`.

  1. `r2 bucket event-notification <subcommand>` becomes `r2 bucket notification <subcommand>`

  Wrangler now stops processing the OPTIONS request before completing the token exchange and only proceeds on the expected GET request.

  When running `unstable_dev()` in its default "test mode", the logging level was set to `none`. This meant any Worker startup errors or helpful warnings wouldn't be shown.

  Currently if a config file doesn't define any binding nor module, running
  `wrangler types` against such file would not produce a `d.ts` file.

  Producing a `d.ts` file can however still be beneficial as it would define a correct
  env interface (even if empty) that can be expanded/referenced by user code (this can
  be particularly convenient for scaffolding tools that may want to always generate an
  env interface).

  Example:
  Before `wrangler types --env-interface MyEnv` run with an empty `wrangler.toml` file
  would not generate any file, after these change it would instead generate a file with
  the following content:

  ```
  interface MyEnv {
  }

  Previously, requests sent to `wrangler dev` with unconsumed bodies could result in `Network connection lost` errors. This change attempts to work around the issue by ensuring incoming request bodies are drained if they're not used. This is a temporary fix whilst we try to address the underlying issue. Whilst we don't think this change will introduce any other issues, it can be disabled by setting the `WRANGLER_DISABLE_REQUEST_BODY_DRAINING=true` environment variable. Note this fix is only applied if you've enabled Wrangler's bundling—`--no-bundle` mode continues to have the previous behaviour.

  Allow users to specify the name of the interface that they want `wrangler types` to generate for the `env` parameter, via the new CLI flag `--env-interface`

  Example:

  ```sh
  wrangler types --env-interface CloudflareEnv
  ```

  generates

  Wrangler has two different types of errors: internal errors caused by something going wrong, and user errors caused by an invalid configuration. Previously, we would encourage users to submit bug reports for user errors, even though there's nothing we can do to fix them. This change ensures we only suggest this for internal errors.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4812 we tried to fix the Origin headers to match the Host header but were overzealous and rewrote Origin headers for external origins (outside of the proxy server's origin).

  This is now fixed, and moreover we rewrite any headers that refer to the proxy server on the request with the configured host and vice versa on the response.

  This should ensure that CORS is not broken in browsers when a different host is being simulated based on routes in the Wrangler configuration.

## 3.28.0

### Minor Changes

- [#4499](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4499) [`cf9c029b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/cf9c029b30e1db3a1c3f9dc4208b9c34021a8ac0) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - feat: Support runtime-agnostic polyfills

  Previously, Wrangler treated any imports of `node:*` modules as build-time errors (unless one of the two Node.js compatibility modes was enabled). This is sometimes overly aggressive, since those imports are often not hit at runtime (for instance, it was impossible to write a library that worked across Node.JS and Workers, using Node packages only when running in Node). Here's an example of a function that would cause Wrangler to fail to build:

  ```ts
  export function randomBytes(length: number) {
  	if (navigator.userAgent !== "Cloudflare-Workers") {
  		return new Uint8Array(require("node:crypto").randomBytes(length));
  	} else {
  		return crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(length));
  	}
  }
  ```

  This function _should_ work in both Workers and Node, since it gates Node-specific functionality behind a user agent check, and falls back to the built-in Workers crypto API. Instead, Wrangler detected the `node:crypto` import and failed with the following error:

  ```
  ✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "node:crypto"

      src/randomBytes.ts:5:36:
        5 │ ... return new Uint8Array(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(length));
          ╵                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The package "node:crypto" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.
    Add "node_compat = true" to your wrangler.toml file to enable Node.js compatibility.
  ```

  This change turns that Wrangler build failure into a warning, which users can choose to ignore if they know the import of `node:*` APIs is safe (because it will never trigger at runtime, for instance):

  ```
  ▲ [WARNING] The package "node:crypto" wasn't found on the file system but is built into node.

    Your Worker may throw errors at runtime unless you enable the "nodejs_compat"
    compatibility flag. Refer to
    https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/ for more details.
    Imported from:
     - src/randomBytes.ts
  ```

  However, in a lot of cases, it's possible to know at _build_ time whether the import is safe. This change also injects `navigator.userAgent` into `esbuild`'s bundle settings as a predefined constant, which means that `esbuild` can tree-shake away imports of `node:*` APIs that are guaranteed not to be hit at runtime, supressing the warning entirely.

  Add a new `cf` field to the `getBindingsProxy` result that people can use to mock the production

  Currently running `wrangler types` against a `wrangler.toml` file without a defined entrypoint (`main` value)
  causes the command to error with the following message:

  ```
  ✘ [ERROR] Missing entry-point: The entry-point should be specified via the command line (e.g. `wrangler types path/to/script`) or the `main` config field.
  ```

  However developers could want to generate types without the entrypoint being defined (for example when using `getBindingsProxy`), so these changes
  make the entrypoint optional for the `types` command, assuming modules syntax if none is specified.

  Previously, when running `wrangler dev`, requests inflight during a UserWorker reload (due to config or source file changes) would fail.

  Now, if those inflight requests are GET or HEAD requests, they will be reproxied against the new UserWorker. This adds to the guarantee that requests made during local development reach the latest worker.

  When Pages is used in conjunction with a full stack framework, the framework

  Previously, when configuring `wrangler pages dev` to use a proxy to a 3rd party dev server,

  Add a new `caches` field to the `getBindingsProxy` result, such field implements a
  no operation (no-op) implementation of the runtime `caches`

  Note: Miniflare exposes a proper `caches` mock, we will want to use that one in
  the future but issues regarding it must be ironed out first, so for the
  time being a no-op will have to do

  Sippy (https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-migration/sippy/) now supports Google Cloud Storage.
  This change updates the `wrangler r2 sippy` commands to take a provider (AWS or GCS) and appropriate configuration arguments.
  If you don't specify `--provider` argument then the command will enter an interactive flow for the user to set the configuration.
  Note that this is a breaking change from the previous behaviour where you could configure AWS as the provider without explictly specifying the `--provider` argument.
  (This breaking change is allowed in a minor release because the Sippy feature and `wrangler r2 sippy` commands are marked as beta.)

  In `wrangler dev` it is possible to set the `upstream_protocol`,
  which is the protocol under which the User Worker believes it has been
  requested, as recorded in the `request.url` that can be used for
  forwarding on requests to the origin.

  Previously, it was not being passed to `wrangler dev` in local mode.
  Instead it was always set to `http`.

  Note that setting `upstream_protocol` to `http` is not supported in
  `wrangler dev` remote mode, which is the case since Wrangler v2.0.

  This setting now defaults to `https` in remote mode (since that is the only option),
  and to the same as `local_protocol` in local mode.

  Previously, DevTools would never refresh source contents after opening a file, even if it was updated on-disk. This could cause issues with step-through debugging as breakpoints set in source files would map to incorrect locations in bundled Worker code. This change ensures DevTools' source cache is cleared on each reload, preventing outdated sources from being displayed.

  The new utility is part of wrangler's JS API (it is not part of the wrangler CLI) and its use is to provide proxy objects to bindings, such objects can be used in Node.js code as if they were actual bindings

  The utility reads the `wrangler.toml` file present in the current working directory in order to discern what bindings should be available (a `wrangler.json` file can be used too, as well as config files with custom paths).

  ## Example

  Assuming that in the current working directory there is a `wrangler.toml` file with the following
  content:

  ```
  [[kv_namespaces]]
  binding = "MY_KV"
  id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  ```

  The utility could be used in a nodejs script in the following way:

  ```js
  import { getBindingsProxy } from "wrangler";

  const { bindings, dispose } = await getBindingsProxy();

  try {
  	const myKv = bindings.MY_KV;
  	const kvValue = await myKv.get("my-kv-key");

  	console.log(`KV Value = ${kvValue}`);
  } finally {
  	await dispose();

  Currently, the drive letter of os.homedir() (the user's home directory) is used to build the path to netstat.exe. However, user directories are not always on the same drive as the Windows installation, in which case the path to netstat will be incorrect. Now we use the %SYSTEMROOT% environment variable which correctly points to the installation path of Windows.

  Only specifying the name and type of a binding instructs the patch API to copy the existing binding over - but we were including the contents of the binding as well. Normally that's OK, but there are some subtle differences between what you specify to _create_ a binding vs what it looks like once it's _created_, specifically for Durable Objects. So instead, we just use the simpler inheritance.

  Previously, if in a `wrangler dev` session you called `console.log()` and threw an unhandled error you'd see an error like `[ERR_ASSERTION]: The expression evaluated to a falsy value`. This change ensures you can do both of these things in the same session.

  Previously, trying to import a file that wasn't explicitly exported from a module would result in an error, but now, better attempts are made to resolve the import using node's module resolution algorithm. It's now possible to do things like this:

  ```js
  import JPEG_DEC_WASM from "@jsquash/jpeg/codec/dec/mozjpeg_dec.wasm";
  ```

  This works even if the `mozjpeg_dec.wasm` file isn't explicitly exported from the `@jsquash/jpeg` module.

  Some full-stack frameworks, such as Next.js, check that the Host header for a server
  side action request matches the host where the application is expected to run.

  In `wrangler dev` we have a Proxy Worker in between the browser and the actual User Worker.
  This Proxy Worker is forwarding on the request from the browser, but then the actual User
  Worker is running on a different host:port combination than that which the browser thinks
  it should be on. This was causing the framework to think the request is malicious and blocking
  it.

  Now we update the request's Host header to that passed from the Proxy Worker in a custom `MF-Original-Url`
  header, but only do this if the request also contains a shared secret between the Proxy Worker
  and User Worker, which is passed via the `MF-Proxy-Shared-Secret` header. This last feature is to
  prevent a malicious website from faking the Host header in a request directly to the User Worker.

  Previously, Wrangler would only apply source mapping to uncaught exceptions. This meant if you caught an exception and logged its stack trace, the call sites would reference built JavaScript files as opposed to source files. This change looks for stack traces in logged messages, and tries to source map them.

  Note source mapping is only applied when outputting logs. `Error#stack` does not return a source mapped stack trace. This means the actual runtime value of `new Error().stack` and the output from `console.log(new Error().stack)` may be different.

### Minor Changes

- [#4547](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4547) [`86c81ff0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/86c81ff0d59e79d2d33f176f69a7c2d1dcd91e02) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - fix: listen on IPv4 loopback only by default on Windows

  Due to a [known issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/1408), `workerd` will only listen on the IPv4 loopback address `127.0.0.1` when it's asked to listen on `localhost`. On Node.js > 17, `localhost` will resolve to the IPv6 loopback address, meaning requests to `workerd` would fail. This change switches to using the IPv4 loopback address throughout Wrangler on Windows, while [workerd#1408](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/issues/1408) gets fixed.

* [#4535](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4535) [`29df8e17`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/29df8e17545bf3926b6d61678b596be809d40c6d) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - Reintroduces some internal refactorings of wrangler dev servers (including `wrangler dev`, `wrangler dev --remote`, and `unstable_dev()`).

  These changes were released in 3.13.0 and reverted in 3.13.1 -- we believe the changes are now more stable and ready for release again.

  There are no changes required for developers to opt-in. Improvements include:

  - fewer 'address in use' errors upon reloads
  - upon config/source file changes, requests are buffered to guarantee the response is from the new version of the Worker

  Previously, Wrangler listened on all interfaces (`*`) by default. This change switches `wrangler (pages) dev` to just listen on local interfaces. Whilst this is technically a breaking change, we've decided the security benefits outweigh the potential disruption caused. If you need to access your dev server from another device on your network, you can use `wrangler (pages) dev --ip *` to restore the previous behaviour.

  This change ensures Wrangler doesn't try to open `http://*` when `*` is used as the dev server's hostname. Instead, Wrangler will now open `http://127.0.0.1`.

* [#4488](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4488) [`3bd57238`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/3bd5723852c8340d04930e056ef1e8f97dc316ae) Thanks [@RamIdeas](https://github.com/RamIdeas)! - Changes the default directory for log files to workaround frameworks that are watching the entire `.wrangler` directory in the project root for changes

  Also includes a fix for commands with `--json` where the log file location message would cause stdout to not be valid JSON. That message now goes to stderr.

Set a directory or specific .log filepath to write logs to with `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=../Desktop/my-logs/` or `WRANGLER_LOG_PATH=../Desktop/my-logs/my-log-file.log`. When specifying a directory or using the default location, a filename with a timestamp is used.

  Wrangler now filters workerd stdout/stderr and marks unactionable messages as debug logs. These debug logs are still observable in the debug log file but will no longer show in the terminal by default without the user setting the env var `WRANGLER_LOG=debug`.

This will prevent unstable_dev from sending a request to NPM on startup to determine whether it needs to be updated.

* [#4179](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4179) [`dd270d00`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/dd270d0065159150ff318f2f06607ddecba6ee9b) Thanks [@matthewdavidrodgers](https://github.com/matthewdavidrodgers)! - Simplify secret:bulk api via script settings

  Firing PUTs to the secret api in parallel has never been a great solution - each request independently needs to lock the script, so running in parallel is at best just as bad as running serially.

  Luckily, we have the script settings PATCH api now, which can update the settings for a script (including secret bindings) at once, which means we don't need any parallelization. However this api doesn't work with a partial list of bindings, so we have to fetch the current bindings and merge in with the new secrets before PATCHing. We can however just omit the value of the binding (i.e. only provide the name and type) which instructs the config service to inherit the existing value, which simplifies this as well. Note that we don't use the bindings in your current wrangler.toml, as you could be in a draft state, and it makes sense as a user that a bulk secrets update won't update anything else. Instead, we use script settings api again to fetch the current state of your bindings.

  This simplified implementation means the operation can only fail or succeed, rather than succeeding in updating some secrets but failing for others. In order to not introduce breaking changes for logging output, the language around "${x} secrets were updated" or "${x} secrets failed" is kept, even if it doesn't make much sense anymore.

### Patch Changes

- [#4402](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4402) [`baa76e77`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/baa76e774038393fb6b491e2c371da53b8b2a676) Thanks [@rozenmd](https://github.com/rozenmd)! - This PR adds a fetch handler that uses `page`, assuming `result_info` provided by the endpoint contains `page`, `per_page`, and `total`

  This is needed as the existing `fetchListResult` handler for fetching potentially paginated results doesn't work for endpoints that don't implement `cursor`.

  If a compatibility date greater than the installed version of `workerd` was
  configured, a warning would be logged. This warning was only actionable if a new
  version of `wrangler` was available. The intent here was to warn if a user set
  a new compatibility date, but forgot to update `wrangler` meaning changes
  enabled by the new date wouldn't take effect. This change hides the warning if
  no update is available.

  It also changes the default compatibility date for `wrangler dev` sessions
  without a configured compatibility date to the installed version of `workerd`.
  This previously defaulted to the current date, which may have been unsupported
  by the installed runtime.

  Previously, when using wasm (or other static files) from an npm package, you would have to import the file like so:

  ```js
  import wasm from "../../node_modules/svg2png-wasm/svg2png_wasm_bg.wasm";
  ```

  This update now allows you to import the file like so, assuming it's exposed and available in the package's `exports` field:

  ```js
  import wasm from "svg2png-wasm/svg2png_wasm_bg.wasm";
  ```

  This will look at the package's `exports` field in `package.json` and resolve the file using [`resolve.exports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve.exports).

  In Cloudflare for SaaS, custom hostnames of third party domain owners can be used in Cloudflare.
  Workers are allowed to intercept these requests based on the routes configuration.

  As Wrangler builds your code, it writes intermediate files to a temporary
  directory that gets cleaned up on exit. Previously, Wrangler used the OS's
  default temporary directory. On Windows, this is usually on the `C:` drive.
  If your source code was on a different drive, our bundling tool would generate
  invalid source maps, breaking breakpoint debugging. This change ensures
  intermediate files are always written to the same drive as sources. It also
  ensures unused build outputs are cleaned up when running `wrangler pages dev`.

  This change also means you no longer need to set `cwd` and
  `resolveSourceMapLocations` in `.vscode/launch.json` when creating an `attach`
  configuration for breakpoint debugging. Your `.vscode/launch.json` should now
  look something like...

  ```jsonc
  {
  	"configurations": [
  		{
  			"name": "Wrangler",
  			"type": "node",
  			"request": "attach",
  			"port": 9229,
  			// These can be omitted, but doing so causes silent errors in the runtime
  			"attachExistingChildren": false,

  Previously, `console.log()` calls before the Workers runtime was ready to

  this should [fix Remix's HMR](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/issues/7616),
  which relies on startup logs to know when the Worker is ready.

  new `--service`|`-s` flag which accepts an array of `BINDING_NAME=SCRIPT_NAME`
  where `BINDING_NAME` is the name of the binding and `SCRIPT_NAME` is the name
  of the worker (as defined in its `wrangler.toml`), such workers need to be
  running locally with with `wrangler dev`.

  For example if a user has a worker named `worker-a`, in order to locally bind
  to that they'll need to open two different terminals, in each navigate to the
  respective worker/pages application and then run respectively `wrangler dev` and
  `wrangler pages ./publicDir --service MY_SERVICE=worker-a` this will add the
  `MY_SERVICE` binding to pages' worker `env` object.

  Note: additionally after the `SCRIPT_NAME` the name of an environment can be specified,
  prefixed by an `@` (as in: `MY_SERVICE=SCRIPT_NAME@PRODUCTION`), this behavior is however
  experimental and not fully properly defined.

  When tailing a tail worker, messages previously had a null event property. Following https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/1248, these events have a valid event, specifying which scripts produced events that caused your tail worker to run.

  As part of rolling this out, we're filtering out tail events in the internal tail infrastructure, so we control when these new messages are forward to tail sessions, and can merge this freely.

  One idiosyncracy to note, however, is that tail workers always report an "OK" status, even if they run out of memory or throw. That is being tracked and worked on separately.

  For projects which are slow to upload - either because of client bandwidth or large numbers of files and sizes - It's possible for the JWT to expire multiple times. Since our network request concurrency is set to 3, it's possible that each time the JWT expires we get 3 failed attempts. This can quickly exhaust our upload attempt count and cause the entire process to bail.

  This change makes it such that jwt refreshes do not count as a failed upload attempt.

### Minor Changes

- [#3726](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3726) [`7d20bdbd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/7d20bdbd4ed7c5003b327a58af8d5c402df9fe2b) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - feat: support partial bundling with configurable external modules

  Setting `find_additional_modules` to `true` in your configuration file will now instruct Wrangler to look for files in
  your `base_dir` that match your configured `rules`, and deploy them as unbundled, external modules with your Worker.
  `base_dir` defaults to the directory containing your `main` entrypoint.

  Wrangler can operate in two modes: the default bundling mode and `--no-bundle` mode. In bundling mode, dynamic imports
  (e.g. `await import("./large-dep.mjs")`) would be bundled into your entrypoint, making lazy loading less effective.
  Additionally, variable dynamic imports (e.g. ``await import(`./lang/${language}.mjs`)``) would always fail at runtime,
  as Wrangler would have no way of knowing which modules to upload. The `--no-bundle` mode sought to address these issues
  by disabling Wrangler's bundling entirely, and just deploying code as is. Unfortunately, this also disabled Wrangler's
  code transformations (e.g. TypeScript compilation, `--assets`, `--test-scheduled`, etc).

  With this change, we now additionally support _partial bundling_. Files are bundled into a single Worker entry-point file
  unless `find_additional_modules` is `true`, and the file matches one of the configured `rules`. See
  https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/bundling/ for more details and examples.

  When using `find_additional_modules` (or `no_bundle`) we find files that

  During local development, inside your worker, the host of `request.url` is inferred from the `routes` in your config.

Wrangler now allows you to interact with buckets in a defined jurisdiction.

  Wrangler R2 operations now support a `-J` flag that allows the user to specify a jurisdiction. When passing the `-J` flag, you will only be able to interact with R2 resources within that jurisdiction.

  ```bash
  # List all of the buckets in the EU jurisdiction
  wrangler r2 bucket list -J eu
  # Downloads the object 'myfile.txt' from the bucket 'mybucket' in EU jurisdiction
  wrangler r2 object get mybucket/myfile.txt -J eu
  ```

  To access R2 buckets that belong to a jurisdiction from Workers, you will need to specify the jurisdiction as well as the bucket name as part of your bindings in your `wrangler.toml`:

  ```toml
  [[r2_buckets]]
  bindings = [
    { binding = "MY_BUCKET", bucket_name = "<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>", jurisdiction = "<JURISDICTION>" }

  Previously `secret"bulk` would only log an error on failure of any of the upload requests.
  Now when 'secret:bulk' has an upload request fail it throws an Error which sends an `process.exit(1)` at the root `.catch()` signal.
  This will enable error handling in programmatic uses of `secret:bulk`.

  # Example of piping in a string
  > echo '{"key":"value"}' | wrangler secret:bulk

  `wrangler deploy` immediately deletes assets that are no longer current, which has a side-effect for existing progressive web app users of seeing 404 errors as the app tries to access assets that no longer exist.

  This new feature:

  - does not change the default behavior of immediately deleting no-longer needed assets.
  - allows users to opt-in to expiring newly obsoleted assets after the provided number of seconds hence, so that current users will have a time buffer before seeing 404 errors.
  - is similar in concept to what was introduced in Wrangler 1.x with https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/2221.
  - is careful to avoid extension of existing expiration targets on already expiring old assets, which may have contributed to unexpectedly large KV storage accumulations (perhaps why, in Wrangler 1.x, the reversion https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/2228 happened).
  - no breaking changes for users relying on the default behavior, but some output changes exist when the new option is used, to indicate the change in behavior.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3583](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3583) [`78ddb8de`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/78ddb8de78152b2cb4180f23b51ee5478637d92d) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - Upgrade Miniflare (and hence `workerd`) to `v3.20230710.0`.

* [#3426](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3426) [`5a74cb55`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/5a74cb559611b1035fe97ebbe870d7061f3b41d0) Thanks [@matthewdavidrodgers](https://github.com/matthewdavidrodgers)! - Prefer non-force deletes unless a Worker is a dependency of another.

  If a Worker is used as a service binding, a durable object namespace, an outbounds for a dynamic dispatch namespace, or a tail consumer, then deleting that Worker will break those existing ones that depend upon it. Deleting with ?force=true allows you to delete anyway, which is currently the default in Wrangler.

  Force deletes are not often necessary, however, and using it as the default has unfortunate consequences in the API. To avoid them, we check if any of those conditions exist, and present the information to the user. If they explicitly acknowledge they're ok with breaking their other Workers, fine, we let them do it. Otherwise, we'll always use the much safer non-force deletes. We also add a "--force" flag to the delete command to skip the checks and confirmation and proceed with ?force=true

  Ensure middleware is only registered on the first request when using module workers.
  This should prevent stack overflows and slowdowns when making large number of requests to `wrangler dev` with infrequent reloads.

  This ensures consistency with other messaging, documentation and our dashboard,
  which all refer to deployments. This also avoids confusion with the similar but
  very different `npm publish` command. `wrangler publish` will remain a
  deprecated alias for now, but will be removed in the next major version of Wrangler.

  `wrangler dev` now runs fully-locally by default, using the open-source Cloudflare Workers runtime [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd).
  To restore the previous behaviour of running on a remote machine with access to production data, use the new `--remote` flag.
  The `--local` and `--experimental-local` flags have been deprecated, as this behaviour is now the default, and will be removed in the next major version.

  Wrangler will now persist local KV, R2, D1, Cache and Durable Object data
  in the `.wrangler` folder, by default, between reloads. This persistence
  directory can be customised with the `--persist-to` flag. The `--persist` flag
  has been removed, as this is now the default behaviour.

  Previously, if Wrangler was installed globally _and_ locally within a project,
  running the global Wrangler would instead invoke the local version.
  This behaviour was contrary to most other JavaScript CLI tools and has now been
  removed. We recommend you use `npx wrangler` instead, which will invoke the
  local version if installed, or install globally if not.

  With this PR, users will be able to run `wrangler d1 create <NAME> --experimental-backend` to create new D1 dbs that use an experimental backend. You can also run `wrangler d1 migrations apply <NAME> experimental-backend` to run migrations against an experimental database.

  On top of that, both `wrangler d1 migrations apply <NAME>` and `wrangler d1 execute <NAME>` now have a configurable `batch-size` flag, as the experimental backend can handle more than 10000 statements at a time.

  - Wrangler no longer buffers all assets into memory before uploading. This should prevent out-of-memory errors when publishing sites with many large files.
  - Wrangler now limits the number of in-flight asset upload requests to 5, fixing the `Too many bulk operations already in progress` error.
  - Wrangler now correctly logs upload progress. Previously, the reported percentage was per upload request group, not across all assets.
  - Wrangler no longer logs all assets to the console by default. Instead, it will just log the first 100. The rest can be shown by setting the `WRANGLER_LOG=debug` environment variable. A splash of colour has also been added.

  This PR fixes a bug in how D1 handles a user's accounts. We've updated the D1 commands to read from config (typically via wrangler.toml) before trying to run commands.

### Minor Changes

- [#2769](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2769) [`0a779904`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/0a77990457652af36c60c52bf9c38c3a69945de4) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - feature: Support modules with `--no-bundle`

  When the `--no-bundle` flag is set, Wrangler now has support for uploading additional modules alongside the entrypoint. This will allow modules to be imported at runtime on Cloudflare's Edge. This respects Wrangler's [module rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bundling) configuration, which means that only imports of non-JS modules will trigger an upload by default. For instance, the following code will now work with `--no-bundle` (assuming the `example.wasm` file exists at the correct path):

  ```js
  // index.js
  import wasm from './example.wasm'

  export default {
    async fetch() {
      await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm, ...)
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  For JS modules, it's necessary to specify an additional [module rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#bundling) (or rules) in your `wrangler.toml` to configure your modules as ES modules or Common JS modules. For instance, to upload additional JavaScript files as ES modules, add the following module rule to your `wrangler.toml`, which tells Wrangler that all `**/*.js` files are ES modules.

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "ESModule", globs = ["**/*.js"]},
  ]
  ```

  If you have Common JS modules, you'd configure Wrangler with a CommonJS rule (the following rule tells Wrangler that all `.cjs` files are Common JS modules):

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "CommonJS", globs = ["**/*.cjs"]},
  ]
  ```

  In most projects, adding a single rule will be sufficient. However, for advanced usecases where you're mixing ES modules and Common JS modules, you'll need to use multiple rule definitions. For instance, the following set of rules will match all `.mjs` files as ES modules, all `.cjs` files as Common JS modules, and the `nested/say-hello.js` file as Common JS.

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "CommonJS", globs = ["nested/say-hello.js", "**/*.cjs"]},
    { type = "ESModule", globs = ["**/*.mjs"]}
  ]
  ```

  If multiple rules overlap, Wrangler will log a warning about the duplicate rules, and will discard additional rules that matches a module. For example, the following rule configuration classifies `dep.js` as both a Common JS module and an ES module:

  ```toml
  rules = [
    { type = "CommonJS", globs = ["dep.js"]},
    { type = "ESModule", globs = ["dep.js"]}
  ]
  ```

  Wrangler will treat `dep.js` as a Common JS module, since that was the first rule that matched, and will log the following warning:

  ```
  ▲ [WARNING] Ignoring duplicate module: dep.js (esm)
  ```

  This also adds a new configuration option to `wrangler.toml`: `base_dir`. Defaulting to the directory of your Worker's main entrypoint, this tells Wrangler where your additional modules are located, and determines the module paths against which your module rule globs are matched.

  For instance, given the following directory structure:

  ```
  - wrangler.toml
  - src/
    - index.html
    - vendor/
      - dependency.js
    - js/
      - index.js
  ```

  If your `wrangler.toml` had `main = "src/js/index.js"`, you would need to set `base_dir = "src"` in order to be able to import `src/vendor/dependency.js` and `src/index.html` from `src/js/index.js`.

  Previously, querystring params would be stripped, causing issues for test cases that depended on them. For example, given the following worker script:

  ```js

  	fetch(req) {
  		const url = new URL(req.url);
  		const name = url.searchParams.get("name");
  		return new Response("Hello, " + name);
  	},
  };
  ```

  would fail the following test case:

  ```js
  const worker = await unstable_dev("script.js");
  const res = await worker.fetch("http://worker?name=Walshy");
  const text = await res.text();
  expect(text).toBe("Hello, Walshy");

  The fallback has now been switched to `log`, and lenient case-insensitive matching is used when setting the level.

  Support send email bindings in order to send emails from a worker. There
  are three types of bindings:

  - Unrestricted: can send email to any verified destination address.
  - Restricted: can only send email to the supplied destination address (which
    does not need to be specified when sending the email but also needs to be a
    verified destination address).
  - Allowlist: can only send email to the supplied list of verified destination
    addresses.

  Going forward Workers will be providing built-in modules (similar to `node:...`) that can be imported using the `cloudflare:...` prefix. This change adds support to the Wrangler bundler to mark these imports as external.

* [#2607](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2607) [`163dccf4`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/163dccf41453e1790fe8e5231d8c1cb8b6ef5a18) Thanks [@jspspike@gmail.com](https://github.com/jspspike@gmail.com)! - feature: add `wrangler deployment view` and `wrangler rollback` subcommands

`wrangler deployments view [deployment-id]` will get the details of a deployment, including bindings and usage model information.
This information can be used to help debug bad deployments.

`wrangler rollback [deployment-id]` will rollback to a specific deployment in the runtime. This will be useful in situations like recovering from a bad
deployment quickly while resolving issues. If a deployment id is not specified wrangler will rollback to the previous deployment. This rollback only changes the code in the runtime and doesn't affect any code or configurations
in a developer's local setup.

`wrangler deployments list` will list the 10 most recent deployments. This command originally existed as `wrangler deployments`

example of `view <deployment-id>` output:

  Previously, `wrangler init` generated a `tsconfig.json` with `"types": ["@cloudflare/workers-types", "vitest"]`, even if Vitest tests weren't generated.
  Unlike Jest, Vitest [doesn't provide global APIs by default](https://vitest.dev/config/#globals), so there's no need for ambient types.

  We now enable bundling by default for a `functions/` folder and for an `_worker.js` in Pages Functions. This allows you to use external modules such as Wasm.

  Wrangler automatically detects whether your code is a `modules` or `service-worker` format Worker based on the presence of a `default` `export`. This check currently works by building your entrypoint with `esbuild` and looking at the output metafile.

  Previously, we were passing `format: "esm"` to `esbuild` when performing this check, which enables _format conversion_. This may introduce `export default` into the built code, even if it wasn't there to start with, resulting in incorrect format detections.

  This change removes `format: "esm"` which disables format conversion when bundling is disabled. See https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format for more details.

### Minor Changes

- [#2629](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2629) [`151733e5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/151733e5d98e95f363b548f9959c2baf418eb7b5) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - Prefer the `workerd` `exports` condition when bundling.

  This can be used to build isomorphic libraries that have different implementations depending on the JavaScript runtime they're running in.
  When bundling, Wrangler will try to load the [`workerd` key](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/#workerd).
  This is the [standard key](https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/#workerd) for the Cloudflare Workers runtime.
  Learn more about the [conditional `exports` field here](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports).

### Patch Changes

- [#2409](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2409) [`89d78c0a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/89d78c0ac444885298ac052b0b3de23b69fb029b) Thanks [@penalosa](https://github.com/penalosa)! - Wrangler now supports an `--experimental-json-config` flag which will read your configuration from a `wrangler.json` file, rather than `wrangler.toml`. The format of this file is exactly the same as the `wrangler.toml` configuration file, except that the syntax is `JSONC` (JSON with comments) rather than `TOML`. This is experimental, and is not recommended for production use.

### Patch Changes

- [#2501](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2501) [`a0e5a491`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/a0e5a4913621cffe757b2d14b6f3f466831f3d7f) Thanks [@geelen](https://github.com/geelen)! - fix: make it possible to query d1 databases from durable objects

  This PR makes it possible to access D1 from Durable Objects.

  To be able to query D1 from your Durable Object, you'll need to install the latest version of wrangler, and redeploy your Worker.

  For a D1 binding like:

  ```toml
  [[d1_databases]]
  binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
  database_name = "my-database-name"
  database_id = "UUID-GOES-HERE"
  preview_database_id = "UUID-GOES-HERE"
  ```

  You'll be able to access your D1 database via `env.DB` in your Durable Object.

  Currently it is not possible to import `wasm` modules in either Pages
  Functions or Pages Advanced Mode projects.

  This commit caries out work to address the aforementioned issue by
  enabling `wasm` module imports in `wrangler pages dev`. As a result,
  Pages users can now import their `wasm` modules withing their Functions
  or `_worker.js` files, and `wrangler pages dev` will correctly bundle
  everything and serve these "external" modules.

  ```
  import hello from "./hello.wasm"

  export async function onRequest() {
  	const module = await WebAssembly.instantiate(hello);
  	return new Response(module.exports.hello);
  }
  ```

* [#2563](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2563) [`5ba39569`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/5ba39569e7ca6e341635b9beb8edebc60ad17dcd) Thanks [@CarmenPopoviciu](https://github.com/CarmenPopoviciu)! - fix: Copy module imports related files to outdir

  When we bundle a Worker `esbuild` takes care of writing the
  results to the output directory. However, if the Worker contains
  any `external` imports, such as text/wasm/binary module imports,
  that cannot be inlined into the same bundle file, `bundleWorker`
  will not copy these files to the output directory. This doesn't
  affect `wrangler publish` per se, because of how the Worker
  upload FormData is created. It does however create some
  inconsistencies when running `wrangler publish --outdir` or
  `wrangler publish --outdir --dry-run`, in that, `outdir` will
  not contain those external import files.

  This commit addresses this issue by making sure the aforementioned
  files do get copied over to `outdir` together with `esbuild`'s
  resulting bundle files.

### Minor Changes

- [#2538](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2538) [`af4f27c5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/af4f27c5966f52e605ab7c16ff9746b7802d3479) Thanks [@edevil](https://github.com/edevil)! - feat: support EmailEvent event type in `wrangler tail`.

* [#2404](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2404) [`3f824347`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/3f824347c624a2cedf4af2b6bbd781b8581b08b5) Thanks [@petebacondarwin](https://github.com/petebacondarwin)! - feat: support bundling the raw Pages `_worker.js` before deploying

  Previously, if you provided a `_worker.js` file, then Pages would simply check the
  file for disallowed imports and then deploy the file as-is.

  Not bundling the `_worker.js` file means that it cannot containing imports to other
  JS files, but also prevents Wrangler from adding shims such as the one for the D1 alpha
  release.

  This change adds the ability to tell Wrangler to pass the `_worker.js` through the
  normal Wrangler bundling process before deploying by setting the `--bundle`
  command line argument to `wrangler pages dev` and `wrangler pages publish`.

  This is in keeping with the same flag for `wrangler publish`.

  Currently bundling is opt-in, flag defaults to `false` if not provided.

  If you are developing Wrangler, or an internal Cloudflare feature, and during testing,
  need Wrangler to target the staging API rather than production, it is now possible by
  setting the `WRANGLER_API_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `staging`.

  This will update all the necessary OAuth and API URLs, update the OAuth client ID, and
  also (if necessary) acquire an Access token for to get through the firewall to the
  staging URLs.

  This fix updates the SQL statement splitting so that it does not split in the middle of compound statements.
  Previously we were using a third party splitting library, but this needed fixing and was actually unnecessary for our purposes.
  So a new splitter has been implemented and the library dependency removed.
  Also the error handling in `d1 migrations apply` has been improved to handle a wider range of error types.

  Before, if you wanted to disable the experimental warning, you would run:

  	{},
  	{ disableExperimentalWarning: true }
  );

  After this change, you'll need to do this instead:

  If the root directory of a project was the same as the build output directory, we were previously uploading the `functions/` directory as static assets. This PR now ensures that the `functions/` files are only used to create Pages Functions and are no longer uploaded as static assets.

  Additionally, we also now _do_ upload `_worker.js`, `_headers`, `_redirects` and `_routes.json` if they aren't immediate children of the build output directory. Previously, we'd ignore all files with this name regardless of location. For example, if you have a `public/blog/how-to-use-pages/_headers` file (where `public` is your build output directory), we will now upload the `_headers` file as a static asset.

* [#2111](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2111) [`ab52f771`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/ab52f7717ffd5411886d1e30aee98f821237ddad) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - feat: Add a `passThroughOnException()` handler in Pages Functions

  This `passThroughOnException()` handler is not as good as the built-in for Workers. We're just adding it now as a stop-gap until we can do the behind-the-scenes plumbing required to make the built-in function work properly.

  We wrap your Pages Functions code in a `try/catch` and on failure, if you call `passThroughOnException()` we defer to the static assets of your project.

  For example:

  ```ts
  export const onRequest = ({ passThroughOnException }) => {
  	passThroughOnException();

  	x; // Would ordinarily throw an error, but instead, static assets are served.
  };
  ```

  Currently, the logic by which we transform routing rules in `_routes.json` to
  regular expressions, so we can perform `pathname` matching & routing when we
  run `wrangler pages dev`, is too permissive, and leads to serving incorrect
  assets for certain url paths.

  For example, a routing rule such as `/foo` will incorrectly match pathname
  `/bar/foo`. Similarly, pathname `/foo` will be incorrectly matched by the
  `/` routing rule.
  This commit fixes our routing rule to pathname matching logic and brings
  `wrangler pages dev` on par with routing in deployed Pages projects.

  This patch deletes any site/asset kv namespaces associated with a worker when `wrangler delete` is used.

  Previously, when trying to publish a worker to a route that was in use by another worker,
  there would be a really unhelpful message about a failed API call. Now, there's a much
  nicer message that tells you what worker is running on that route, and gives you a link
  to the workers overview page so you can unassign it if you want.

  Previously, when a user wanted to publish a worker to https://workers.dev by setting `workers_dev = true` in their `wrangler.toml`,

  Now, we offer to create one for them. It's not implemented for `wrangler dev`, which also expects you to have registered a

  Wrangler depends on terminals supporting [raw mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_mode). Previously, attempting to run wrangler from a terminal that didn't support raw mode would result in
  an Ink error, which was both an exposure of an internal implementation detail to the user and also not actionable:

  ```text
    ERROR Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin, which Ink uses
         as input stream by default.
         Read about how to prevent this error on
         https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/#israwmodesupported
  ```

  Now, we provide a much nicer error, which provides an easy next step for th user:

  ```text

  ERROR: This terminal doesn't support raw mode.

  Wrangler uses raw mode to read user input and write output to the terminal, and won't function correctly without it.

  Try running your previous command in a terminal that supports raw mode, such as Command Prompt or Powershell.
  ```

  By default, wrangler.toml is the source of truth for your environment configuration, like a terraform file.

  If you change your settings (particularly your vars) in the dashboard, wrangler _will_ override them. If you want to disable this behavior, set this field to true.

  Between wrangler 2.0.28 and 2.1.5, by default wrangler would _not_ delete your vars by default, breaking expected wrangler.toml behaviour.

  Using the new middleware (https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1735), we implement a way of testing scheduled workers from a fetch using `wrangler dev` in remote mode, by passing a new command line flag `--test-scheduled`. This exposes a route `/__scheduled` which will trigger the scheduled event.

  - useLocalWorker
  - useCustomBuild
  - useTmpDir

  As a side-effect of removing React, tests should run faster in CI.

  The Worker-for-Platforms team would like to rename this field to more closely match what it's called internally. This fix does a search+replace on this term.

  Currently, when we publish a worker, we delete an pre-existing bindings if they're not otherwise defined in `wrangler.toml`, and overwrite existing ones. But folks may be deploying with wrangler, and changing environment variables on the fly (like marketing messages, etc). It's annoying when deploying via wrangler blows away those values.

  This patch fixes one of those issues. It will not delete any older bindings that are not in wrangler.toml. It still _does_ overwrite existing vars, but at least this gives a way for developers to have some vars that are not blown away on every publish.

  Because we'd used a default for 0.0.0.0 for the `--ip` flag, `wrangler dev` was overriding the value specified in `wrangler.toml` under `dev.ip`. This fix removes the default value (since it's being set when normalising config anyway).

  This enables passing values for `[vars]` and `[define]` via the cli. We have a number of usecases where the values to be injected during dev/publish aren't available statically (eg: a version string, some identifier for 3p libraries, etc) and reading those values only from `wrangler.toml` isn't good ergonomically. So we can now read those values when passed through the CLI.

  Example: add a var during dev: `wrangler dev --var xyz:123` will inject the var `xyz` with string `"123"`

  (note, only strings allowed for `--var`)

  substitute a global value: `wrangler dev --define XYZ:123` will replace every global identifier `XYZ` with the value `123`.

  The same flags also work with `wrangler publish`.

  Also, you can use actual environment vars in these commands. e.g.: `wrangler dev --var xyz:$XYZ` will set `xyz` to whatever `XYZ` has been set to in the terminal environment.

  Building on [the recent work for multi-worker Service bindings in local dev](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1503), this now adds support for direct Durable Object namespace bindings.

  A parent (calling) Worker will look for child Workers (where the Durable Object has been defined) by matching the `script_name` configuration option with the child's Service name. For example, if you have a Worker A which defines a Durable Object, `MyDurableObject`, and Worker B which references A's Durable Object:

  ```toml
  name = "A"

  [durable_objects]
  bindings = [
  	{ name = "MY_DO", class_name = "MyDurableObject" }
  ]
  ```

  ```toml
  name = "B"

  [durable_objects]
  bindings = [
  	{ name = "REFERENCED_DO", class_name = "MyDurableObject", script_name = "A" }
  ]
  ```

  `MY_DO` will work as normal in Worker A. `REFERENCED_DO` in Worker B will point at A's Durable Object.

  Note: this only works in local mode (`wrangler dev --local`) at present.

  Often users experience issues due to tokens not having the correct permissions associated with them (often due to new scopes being created for new products). With this, we print out a list of permissions associated with OAuth tokens with the `wrangler whoami` command to help them debug for OAuth tokens. We cannot access the permissions on an API key, so we direct the user to the location in the dashboard to achieve this.
  We also cache the scopes of OAuth tokens alongside the access and refresh tokens in the .wrangler/config file to achieve this.

  Currently unable to implement https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1371 - instead directs the user to the dashboard.

  Preamble: Typically, a Worker has been the _unit_ of a javascript project on our platform. Any logic that you need, you fit into one worker, ~ 1MB of javascript and bindings. If you wanted to deploy a larger application, you could define different workers on different routes. This is fine for microservice style architectures, but not all projects can be cleaved along the route boundaries; you lose out on sharing code and resources, and can still cross the size limit with heavy dependencies.

  Service bindings provide a novel mechanism for composing multiple workers into a unified architecture. You could deploy shared code into a worker, and make requests to it from another worker. This lets you architect your code along functional boundaries, while also providing some relief to the 1MB size limit.

  I propose a model for developing multiple bound workers in a single project.

  Consider Worker A, at `workers/a.js`, with a `wrangler.toml` like so:

  ```toml
  name = 'A'

  [[services]]
  binding = 'Bee'
  service = 'B'
  ```

  and content like so:

  ```js
  export default {
  	fetch(req, env) {
  		return env.Bee.fetch(req);
  	},
  };
  ```

  Consider Worker B, at `workers/b.js`, with a `wrangler.toml` like so:

  ```toml
  name = 'B'
  ```

  and content like so:

  ```js
  export default {
  	fetch(req, env) {
  		return new Response("Hello World");
  	},
  };
  ```

  So, a worker A, bound to B, that simply passes on the request to B.

  ## Local mode:

  Currently, when I run `wrangler dev --local` on A (or switch from remote to local mode during a dev session), and make requests to A, they'll fail because the bindings don't exist in local mode.

  What I'd like, is to be able to run `wrangler dev --local` on B as well, and have my dev instance of A make requests to the dev instance of B. When I'm happy with my changes, I'd simply deploy both workers (again, ideally as a batched publish).

  ## Proposal: A local dev registry for workers.

  - Running `wrangler dev` on a machine should start up a local service registry (if there isn't one loaded already) as a server on a well known port.
  - Further, it should then "register" itself with the registry with metadata about itself; whether it's running in remote/local mode, the port and ip its dev server is listening on, and any additional configuration (eg: in remote mode, a couple of extra headers have to be added to every request made to the dev session, so we'd add that data into the registry as well.)
  - Every worker that has service bindings configured, should intercept requests to said binding, and instead make a request to the locally running instance of the service. It could rewrite these requests as it pleases.

  (In future PRs, we'll introduce a system for doing the same with remote mode dev, as well as mixed mode. )

  This adds an internal mechanism for applying multiple "middleware"/facades on to workers. This lets us add functionality during dev and/or publish, where we can modify requests or env, or other ideas. (See https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1466 for actual usecases)

  As part of this, I implemented a simple facade that formats errors in dev. To enable it you need to set an environment variable `FORMAT_WRANGLER_ERRORS=true`. This _isn't_ a new feature we're shipping with wrangler, it's simply to demonstrate how to write middleware. We'll probably remove it in the future.

  Couple things cleaned up here:

  Originally the usage of the /domains api (for publishing to custom domains) was a bit clumsy: we would attempt to optimistically publish, but the api would eagerly fail with specific error codes on why it occurred. This made for some weird control flow for retries with override flags, as well as fragile extraction of error messages.

  Now we use the new /domains/changeset api to generate a changeset of actions required to get to a new state of custom domains, which informs us up front of which domains would need to be updated and overridden, and we can pass flags as needed. I do make an extra hop back to the api to lookup what the custom domains requiring updates are already attached to, but given how helpful I imagine that to be, I'm for it.

  I also updated the api used for publishing the domains, from /domains to /domains/records. The latter was added to allow us to add flexibility for things like the /domains/changeset resource, and thus the former is being deprecated

  If Wrangler is running in non-interactive mode (such as in a CI job) and the user has not already given permission
  we will assume that we cannot send usage metrics.

  The aim of this feature is to help us learn what and how features of Wrangler (and also the Cloudflare dashboard)
  are being used in order to improve the developer experience.

  Our entrypoint for wrangler (`bin/wrangler.js`) needs to run in older versions of node and log a message to the user that they need to upgrade their version of node. Sometimes we use syntax in this entrypoint that doesn't run in older versions of node. crashing the script and failing to log the message. This fix adds a test in CI to make sure we don't regress on that behaviour (as well as fixing the current newer syntax usage)

  When `wrangler pages publish` is run, we make calls to an upload endpoint which could be rate limited and therefore fail. We currently retry those calls after a linear backoff. This change makes that backoff exponential which should reduce the likelihood of subsequent calls being rate limited.

  In Workers published to the Edge (rather than previews) there is a bug where a custom port on a downstream fetch request is ignored, defaulting to the standard port.
  For example, `https://my.example.com:668` will actually send the request to `https://my.example.com:443`.

  This does not happen when using `wrangler dev` (both in remote and local mode), but to ensure that developers are aware of it this change displays a runtime warning in the console when the bug is hit.

  We can pass routes when creating a `dev` session.

We were previously passing `*/*`, i.e, matching _all_ routes in dev; this fix now passes configured routes instead.

  This fix renames the `--no-build` cli arg to `--no-bundle`. `no-build` wasn't a great name because it would imply that we don't run custom builds specified under `[build]` which isn't true. So we rename closer to what wrangler actually does, which is bundling the input. This also makes it clearer that it's a single file upload.

  This adds caching for account id fetch/selection for all wrangler commands.

  Currently, if we have an api/oauth token, but haven't provided an account id, we fetch account information from cloudflare. If a user has just one account id, we automatically choose that. If there are more than one, then we show a dropdown and ask the user to pick one. This is convenient, and lets the user not have to specify their account id when starting a project.

  However, if does make startup slow, since it has to do that fetch every time. It's also annoying for folks with multiple account ids because they have to pick their account id every time.

  So we now cache the account details into `node_modules/.cache/wrangler` (much like pages already does with account id and project name).

  This patch also refactors `config-cache.ts`; it only caches if there's a `node_modules` folder, and it looks for the closest node_modules folder (and not directly in cwd). I also added tests for when a `node_modules` folder isn't available. It also trims the message that we log to terminal.

  Previously, we would be creating a fresh session for every script change during remote dev. While this _worked_, it makes iterating slower, and unnecessarily discards state. This fix makes it so we create only a single session for remote dev, and reuses that session on every script change. This also means we can use a single script id for every worker in a session (when a name isn't already given). Further, we also make the prewarming call of the preview space be non-blocking.

  In older templates, (i.e made for Wrangler v1.x), `account_id =''` is considered as a valid input, but then ignored. With Wrangler 2, when running wrangler dev, we log an error, but it fixes itself after we get an account id. Much like https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1329, the fix here is to normalise that value when we see it, and replace it with `undefined` while logging a warning.

  This fix also tweaks the messaging for a blank route value to suggest some user action.

  The maximum _request_ size for a batch upload is 100 MB. We were previously calculating the upload key value to be under _100 MiB_. Further, with a few bytes here and there, the size of the request can exceed 100 MiB. So this fix calculate using MB instead of MiB, but also brings down our own limit to 98 MB so there's some wiggle room for uploads.

  This feature les you bind a worker to a dynamic dispatch namespaces, which may have other workers bound inside it. (See https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-for-platforms/). Inside your `wrangler.toml`, you would add

  ```toml
  [[worker_namespaces]]
  binding = 'dispatcher' # available as env.dispatcher in your worker
  namespace = 'namespace-name' # the name of the namespace being bound

  This implements `config.define`. This lets the user define a map of keys to strings that will be substituted in the worker's source. This is particularly useful when combined with environments. A common usecase is for values that are sent along with metrics events; environment name, public keys, version numbers, etc. It's also sometimes a workaround for the usability of module env vars, which otherwise have to be threaded through request function stacks.

  As raised in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1254, it was discovered that binary uploads were being mangled by wrangler 2, whereas they worked in wrangler 1. This is because they were read into a string by providing an explicit encoding of `utf-8`. This fix reads provided files into a node `Buffer` that is then passed directly to the request.

  Subsequently https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1273 was raised in relation to a similar issue with gets from wrangler 2. This was happening due to the downloaded file being converted to `utf-8` encoding as it was pushed through `console.log`. By leveraging `process.stdout.write` we can push the fetched `ArrayBuffer` to std out directly without inferring any specific encoding value.

  If `git` does not support the `--initial-branch` argument then just fallback to the default initial branch name.

  We tried to be more clever about this but there are two many weird corner cases with different git versions on different architectures.
  Now we do our best, with recent versions of git, to ensure that the branch is called `main` but otherwise just make sure we don't crash.

  Users will frequently install `wrangler` globally to run commands like `wrangler init`, but we also recommend pinning a specific version of `wrangler` in a project's `package.json`.

  Since we use a facade worker with `--assets`, an entry point is not strictly necessary. This makes a common usecase of "deploy a bunch of static assets" extremely easy to start, as a one liner `npx wrangler dev --assets path/to/folder` (and same with `publish`).

  When initializing a new project (via `wrangler init`) we attempt to reuse files in the current

  package.json and tsconfig.json and use those instead of creating new ones.

  Now we only do this if you do not specify a name for the new Worker. If you do specify a name,

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/1241, we removed the vendored version of `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`, as well as the build configuration that would point to the vendored version when compiling a worker using `--experimental-public`. However, wrangler can be used where it's not installed in the `package.json` for the worker, or even when there's no package.json at all (like when wrangler is installed globally, or used with `npx`). In this situation, if the user doesn't have `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` installed, then building the worker will fail. We don't want to make the user install this themselves, so instead we point to a barrel import for the library in the facade for the worker.

This would make the backend not associate the dev session with any resources that were otherwise assigned to the script (specifically for secrets, but other stuff as well) The fix is simply to use the worker name (when available) as the script ID.

  Previously, if you are not logged in when running `wrangler dev` it will only try to log you in
  if you start in "remote" mode. In "local" mode there is no need to be logged in, so it doesn't
  bother to try to login, and then will crash if you switch to "remote" mode interactively.

  The problem was that we were only attempting to login once before creating the `<Remote>` component.
  Now this logic has been moved into a `useEffect()` inside `<Remote>` so that it will be run whether
  starting in "remote" or transitioning to "remote" from "local".

  The fact that the check is no longer done before creating the components is proven by removing the
  `mockAccountId()` and `mockApiToken()` calls from the `dev.test.ts` files.

  While we wait for changes to the CF API to support API tokens that do not have
  "All Zone" permissions, this change provides a workaround for most scenarios.

  If the bulk-route request fails with an authorization error, then we fallback
  to the Wrangler v1 approach, which sends individual route updates via a zone-based
  endpoint.

  When `wrangler init` is used to create a new Scheduled Worker a cron trigger (1 \* \* \* \*) will be added to wrangler.toml, but only if wrangler.toml is being created during init. If wrangler.toml exists prior to running `wrangler init` then wrangler.toml will remain unchanged even if the user selects the "Scheduled Handler" option. This is as per existing tests in init.test.ts that ensure wrangler.toml is never overwritten after agreeing to prompts. That can change if it needs to.

  Because we were calling `printBindings` during the render phase of `<Dev/>`, we were logging the bindings multiple times (render can be called multiple times, and the interaction of Ink's stdout output intermingled with console is a bit weird). We could have put it into an effect, but I think a better solution here is to simply log it before we even start rendering `<Dev/>` (so we could see the bindings even if Dev fails to load, for example).

  This also adds a fix that masks any overriden values so that we don't accidentally log potential secrets into the terminal.

  This does a small refactor -

  - During publish, we were checking whether `[migrations]` were defined in the presence of `[durable_objects]`, and warning if not. This moves it into the config validation step, which means it'll check for all commands (but notably `dev`)

This adds experimental support for service bindings, aka worker-to-worker bindings. It's lets you "call" a worker from another worker, without incurring any network cost, and (ideally) with much less latency. To use it, define a `[services]` field in `wrangler.toml`, which is a map of bindings to worker names (and environment). Let's say you already have a worker named "my-worker" deployed. In another worker's configuration, you can create a service binding to it like so:

```toml
[[services]]
binding = "MYWORKER"
service = "my-worker"
environment = "production" # optional, defaults to the worker's `default_environment` for now
````

And in your worker, you can call it like so:

```js
export default {
	fetch(req, env, ctx) {
		return env.MYWORKER.fetch(new Request("http://domain/some-path"));
	},
};

  We check for the presence of Git by trying to run `git --version`.
  On non-Windows we get an Error with `code` set to "ENOENT".
  One Windows we get a different error:

  ```
  {
    "shortMessage":"Command failed with exit code 1: git --version",
    "command":"git --version",
    "escapedCommand":"git --version",
    "exitCode":1,

    "failed":true,
    "timedOut":false,
    "isCanceled":false,
    "killed":false
  }
  ```

  Since we don't really care what the error is, now we just assume that Git
  is not available if an error is thrown.

  With the release of Custom Domains for workers, users can publish directly to a custom domain on a route, rather than creating a dummy DNS record first and manually pointing the worker over - this adds the same support to wrangler.

  Users declare routes as normal, but to indicate that a route should be treated as a custom domain, a user simply uses the object format in the toml file, but with a new key: custom_domain (i.e. `routes = [{ pattern = "api.example.com", custom_domain = true }]`)

  When wrangler sees a route like this, it peels them off from the rest of the routes and publishes them separately, using the /domains api. This api is very defensive, erroring eagerly if there are conflicts in existing Custom Domains or managed DNS records. In the case of conflicts, wrangler prompts for confirmation, and then retries with parameters to indicate overriding is allowed.

  On Windows, the following command `wrangler pages dev -- foo bar` would error

  passed to Yargs as separate arguments.

  A workaround is to put the command in quotes: `wrangler pages dev -- "foo bar"`.
  But this fix makes the `command` argument variadic, which also solves the problem.

  When we start up the CLI, we check what the minimum version of supported node is, and throw an error if it isn't at least 16.7. However, the script that runs this, imports `node:child_process` and `node:path`, which was only introduced in 16.7. It was backported to older versions of node, but only in last updates to majors. So for example, if someone used 14.15.4, the script would throw because it wouldn't be able to find `node:child_process` (but it _would_ work on v14.19.2).

  The fix here is to not use the prefixed versions of these built-ins in the bootstrap script. Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/979

  We detect whether a worker is a "modules" format worker by the presence of a `default` export. This is a pretty good heuristic overall, but sometimes folks can make mistakes. One situation that's popped up a few times, is people writing exports, but still writing it in "service worker" format. We detect this fine, and log a warning about the exports, but send it up with the exports included. Unfortunately, our runtime throws when we mark a worker as a service worker, but still has exports. This patch fixes it so that the exports are not included in a service-worker worker.

  Note that if you're missing an event listener, it'll still error with "No event handlers were registered. This script does nothing." but that's a better error than the SyntaxError _even when the listener was there_.

  This tweaks the mssage when a `.dev.vars` file is used so that it doesn't imply that the user has to copy the values from it into their `wrangler.toml`.

* [#880](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/880) [`aad1418`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/aad1418a388edddc2096c20b48fb37cdff7c51ff) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - fix: Stop unnecessarily amalgamating duplicate headers in Pages Functions

  Added a check in non-TTY environments for `account_id`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. If `account_id` exists in `wrangler.toml`
  then `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is not needed in non-TTY scope. The `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is necessary in non-TTY scope and will always error if missing.

  Previously, when a warning or error was logged, the entire message
  was formatted in bold font. This change makes only the first line of
  the message bold, and the rest is formatted with a normal font.

  values to the current environment. An example would be to provide a specific
  CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID value.

  Instead of logging "Unrecognised input" when hitting return/enter in a confirm dialog, we should accept it as a confirmation. This patch also makes the default choice "y" bold in the dialog.

  The `vars` bindings can be specified in the `wrangler.toml` configuration file.
  But "secret" `vars` are usually only provided at the server -
  either by creating them in the Dashboard UI, or using the `wrangler secret` command.

  It is useful during development, to provide these types of variable locally.
  When running `wrangler dev` we will look for a file called `.dev.vars`, situated
  next to the `wrangler.toml` file (or in the current working directory if there is no
  `wrangler.toml`). Any values in this file, formatted like a `dotenv` file, will add to
  or override `vars` bindings provided in the `wrangler.toml`.

  This means that running `wrangler init .` will create a worker in the current directory,
  and the worker's name will be the name of the current directory.

  You can also run `wrangler init path/to/my-worker` and a worker will be created at
  `[CWD]/path/to/my-worker` with the name `my-worker`,

  This adds an experimental node.js compatibility mode. It can be enabled by adding `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`, or by passing `--node-compat` as a command line arg for `dev`/`publish` commands. This is currently powered by `@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill` (which in itself is powered by `rollup-plugin-node-polyfills`).

  We'd previously added this, and then removed it because the quality of the polyfills isn't great. We're reintroducing it regardless so we can start getting feedback on its usage, and it sets up a foundation for replacing it with our own, hopefully better maintained polyfills.

  Of particular note, this means that what we promised in https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-stripe-support-in-workers/ now actually works.

  This patch also addresses some dependency issues, specifically leftover entries in package-lock.json.

  Certain runtime APIs are only available to workers during the "request context",
  which is any code that returns after receiving a request and before returning
  a response.

  Miniflare emulates this behavior by using an [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) and
  [checking at runtime](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/blob/master/packages/shared/src/context.ts#L21-L36)
  to see if you're using those APIs during the request context.

  In certain environments `AsyncLocalStorage` is unavailable, such as in a
  [webcontainer](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core).
  This function figures out if we're able to run those "request context" checks
  and returns [a set of options](https://miniflare.dev/core/standards#global-functionality-limits)
  that indicate to miniflare whether to run the checks or not.

  This removes the timeout we have for custom builds. We shouldn't be applying this timeout anyway, since it doesn't block wrangler, just the user themselves. Further, in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/759, we changed the custom build's process stdout/stderr config to "pipe" to pass tests, however that meant we wouldn't see logs in the terminal anymore. This patch removes the timeout, and brings back proper logging for custom builds.

  This fix -

  - passes the correct query param to check whether a workers.dev subdomain has already been published/enabled
  - thus enabling it only when it's not been enabled
  - it also disables it only when it's explicitly knows it's already been enabled

  The effect of this is that publishes are much faster.

  There's some interference between our data fetching library `undici` and node 18's new `fetch` and co. (powered by `undici` internally) which replaces the filename of `File`s attached to `FormData`s with a generic `blob` (likely this code - https://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/615f6170f4bd39630224c038d1ea5bf505d292af/lib/fetch/formdata.js#L246-L250). It's still not clear why it does so, and it's hard to make an isolated example of this.

  Regardless, disabling the new `fetch` functionality makes `undici` use its own base classes, avoiding the problem for now, and unblocking our release. We'll keep investigating and look for a proper fix.

  It can be useful to do a dry run of publishing. Developers want peace of mind that a project will compile before actually publishing to live servers. Combined with `--outdir`, this is also useful for testing the output of `publish`. Further, it gives developers a chance to upload our generated sourcemap to a service like sentry etc, so that errors from the worker can be mapped against actual source code, but before the service actually goes live.

  With `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` in `dev`, we were clobbering a single folder with data from kv/do/cache. This patch gives individual folders for them. It also enables persistence even when this is not true, but that stays only for the length of a session, and cleans itself up when the dev session ends.

  We currently log an `AbortError` with a stack if we exit `wrangler dev`'s startup process before it's done. This fix skips logging that error (since it's not an exception).

  It can be useful to introspect built assets. A leading usecase is to upload the sourcemap that we generate to services like sentry etc, so that errors from the worker can be mapped against actual source code. We introduce a `--outdir` cli arg to specify a path to generate built assets at, which doesn't get cleaned up after publishing. We are _not_ adding this to `wrangler.toml` just yet, but could in the future if it looks appropriate there.

  This enables optionally passing a route as `{pattern: string, zone_id: string}`. There are scenarios where we need to explicitly pass a zone_id to the api, so this enables that.

  This sets up `--experiment-enable-local-persistence` to explicitly use `process.cwd() + wrangler-local-state` as a path to store values.

  If a user hasn't logged in and then they run a command that needs a login they'll get bounced to the login flow.
  The login flow (if completed) would write their shiny new OAuth2 credentials to disk, but wouldn't reload the

  wouldn't be aware of it.

  This implements `[data_blobs]` support for service-worker workers, as well as enabling Data module support for service-worker workers. `data_blob` is a supported binding type, but we never implemented support for it in v1.

  When a developer uses `--env` to specify an environment name, the Worker name should
  be computed from the top-level Worker name and the environment name.

  When the given environment name does not match those in the wrangler.toml, we error.
  But if no environments have been specified in the wrangler.toml, at all, then we only
  log a warning and continue.

  In this second case, we were reusing the top-level environment, which did not have the
  correct legacy environment fields set, such as the name. Now we ensure that such an
  environment is created as needed.

  When `workers_dev` is not configured, we had a bug where it would default to true inside an environment even when there were routes defined, thus publishing both to a `workers.dev` subdomain as well as the defined routes. The fix is to default `workers_dev` to `undefined`, and check when publishing whether or not to publish to `workers.dev`/defined routes.

  - We consider jsx to be regular js, and have setup our esbuild process to process js/mjs/cjs files as jsx.

  We don't want to have, for example, a KV namespace named "DATA"
  and a Durable Object also named "DATA". Then it would be ambiguous
  what exactly would live at `env.DATA` (or in the case of service workers,
  the `DATA` global) which could lead to unexpected behavior -- and errors.

  Similarly, we don't want to have multiple resources of the same type
  bound to the same name. If you've been working with some KV namespace
  called "DATA", and you add a second namespace but don't change the binding
  to something else (maybe you're copying-and-pasting and just changed out the `id`),
  you could be reading entirely the wrong stuff out of your KV store.

  So now we check for those sorts of situations and throw an error if
  we find that we've encountered one.

  An extremely common pattern in the js ecosystem is to add additional behaviour gated by the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV`. For example, React leverages it heavily to add dev-time checks and warnings/errors, and to load dev/production versions of code. By doing this substitution ourselves, we can get a significant runtime boost in libraries/code that leverage this.

  This does NOT tackle the additional features of either minification, or proper node compatibility, or injecting wrangler's own environment name, which we will tackle in future PRs.

This broke how miniflare resolves modules, and led back to the dreaded "path should be a `path.relative()`d string" error. The fix is to simply pass the cwd to the `spawn` call.

  Test plan:

  Now, when we normalize and validate the raw config, we pass in the currently
  active environment name, and the config that is returned contains all the
  environment fields correctly normalized (including inheritance) at the top
  level of the config object. This avoids other commands from having to check
  both the current named environment and the top-level config for such fields.

  Also, now, handle the case where the active environment name passed in via the
  `--env` command line argument does not match any of the named environments
  in the configuration:

  - This is an error if there are named environments configured;
  - or only a warning if there are no named environments configured.

  When implementing legacy module specifiers, we didn't throughly test the interaction when there weren't any other files next to the entry worker, and importing npm modules. It would create a Regex that matched _every_ import, and fail because a file of that name wasn't present in the source directory. This fix constructs a better regex, applies it only when there are more files next to the worker, and increases test coverage for that scenario.

  We rely on Chromium-based devtools for debugging workers, so when opening up the devtools URL,

  This consolidates some logic into `getEntry()`, namely including `guessWorkerFormat()` and custom builds. This simplifies the code for both `dev` and `publish`.

  - Previously, the implementation of custom builds inside `dev` assumed it could be a long running process; however it's not (else consider that `publish` would never work).
  - By running custom builds inside `getEntry()`, we can be certain that the entry point exists as we validate it and before we enter `dev`/`publish`, simplifying their internals
  - We don't have to do periodic checks inside `wrangler dev` because it's now a one shot build (and always should have been)
  - This expands test coverage a little for both `dev` and `publish`.
  - The 'format' of a worker is intrinsic to its contents, so it makes sense to establish its value inside `getEntry()`
  - This also means less async logic inside `<Dev/>`, which is always a good thing

  This implements Wrangler v1.x style module specifiers, but also logs a deprecation warning for every usage.

  Consider a project like so:

  ```
    project
    ├── index.js
    └── some-dependency.js
  ```

  where the content of `index.js` is:

  ```jsx
  import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";

  addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {});
  ```

  `wrangler` 1.x would resolve `import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";` to the file `some-dependency.js`. This will work in `wrangler` v2, but it will log a deprecation warning. Instead, you should rewrite the import to specify that it's a relative path, like so:

  ```diff
  - import SomeDependency from "some-dependency.js";
  + import SomeDependency from "./some-dependency.js";
  ```

  In a near future version, this will become a breaking deprecation and throw an error.

  (This also updates `workers-chat-demo` to use the older style specifier, since that's how it currently is at https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-chat-demo)

  Known issue: This might not work as expected with `.js`/`.cjs`/`.mjs` files as expected, but that's something to be fixed overall with the module system.

  Sentry's SDK automatically tracks "breadcrumbs", which are pieces of information
  that get tracked leading up to an exception. This can be useful for debugging
  errors because it gives better insight into what happens before an error occurs,
  so you can more easily understand and recreate exactly what happened before an
  error occurred.

  Unfortunately, Sentry automatically includes all `console` statements. And since
  we use the console a lot (e.g. logging every request received in `wrangler dev`),
  this is mostly useless. Additionally, since developers frequently use the console
  to debug their workers we end up with a bunch of data that is not only irrelevant
  to the reported error, but also contains data that could be potentially sensitive.

  For now, we're turning off breadcrumbs entirely. Later, we might wish to add our
  own breadcrumbs manually (e.g. add a "wrangler dev" breadcrumb when a user runs
  `wrangler dev`), at which point we can selectively enable breadcrumbs to catch
  only the ones we've put in there ourselves.

  This change adds full support for the setting the protocol that the localhost proxy server listens to.
  Previously, it was only possible to use `HTTP`. But now you can set it to `HTTPS` as well.

  To support `HTTPS`, Wrangler needs an SSL certificate.
  Wrangler now generates a self-signed certificate, as needed, and caches it in the `~/.wrangler/local-cert` directory.
  These certificates expire after 30 days and are regenerated by Wrangler as needed.

  Note that if you use HTTPS then your browser will complain about the self-signed and you must tell it to accept the certificate before it will let you access the page.

  This expires any previously uploaded assets when using a Sites / `[site]` configuration. Because we currently do a full iteration of a namespace's keys when publishing, for rapidly changing sites this means that uploads get slower and slower. We can't just delete unused assets because it leads to occasional 404s on older publishes while we're publishing. So we expire previous assets while uploading new ones. The implementation/constraints of the kv api means that uploads may become slower, but should hopefully be faster overall. These optimisations also only matter for rapidly changing sites, so common usecases still have the same perf characteristics.

  With unnamed workers, we use the filename as the name of the worker, which isn't a valid name for workers because of the `.` (This break was introduced in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/545). The preview service accepts unnamed workers and generates a hash anyway, so the fix is to simply not send it, and use the host that the service provides.

  Now one should use `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_BASE_URL` rather than `CF_API_TOKEN`, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_API_BASE_URL`, which have been deprecated.

  If you use the deprecated variables they will still work but you will see a warning message.

  Within the Cloudflare tooling ecosystem, we have a mix of `CF_` and `CLOUDFLARE_`
  for prefixing environment variables. Until recently, many of the tools
  were fine with `CF_` however, there started to be conflicts with
  external tools (such as Cloudfoundary CLI), which also uses `CF_` as a
  prefix, and would potentially be reading and writing the same value the
  Cloudflare tooling.

  The Go SDK[1], Terraform[2] and cf-terraforming[3] have made the jump to
  the `CLOUDFLARE_` prefix for environment variable prefix.

  In future, all SDKs will use this prefix for consistency and to allow all the tooling to reuse the same environment variables in the scenario where they are present.

  This implements a top level `main` field for `wrangler.toml` to define an entry point for the worker , and adds a deprecation warning for `build.upload.main`. The deprecation warning is detailed enough to give the exact line to copy-paste into your config file. Example -

  ```
  The `build.upload` field is deprecated. Delete the `build.upload` field, and add this to your configuration file:

  main = "src/chat.mjs"
  ```

  This also makes `./dist` a default for `build.upload.dir`, to match Wrangler v1's behaviour.

  We'd originally planned for `--local` mode to be a thing across all wrangler commands. In hindsight, that didn't make much sense, since every command other than `wrangler dev` assumes some interaction with cloudflare and their API. The only command other than dev where this "worked" was `kv`, but even that didn't make sense because wrangler dev wouldn't even read from it. We also have `--experimental-enable-local-persistence` there anyway.

  So this moves the `--local` flag to only apply for `wrangler dev` and removes any trace from other commands.

  This implements support for `[text_blobs]` as defined by https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1677.

  Text blobs can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in `wrangler.toml` as -

  ```
  [text_blobs]
  MYTEXT = "./path/to/my-text.file"
  ```

  The content of the file will then be available as the global `MYTEXT` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  Workers Sites now uses `[text_blobs]` internally. Previously, we were inlining the asset manifest into the worker itself, but we now attach the asset manifest to the uploaded worker. I also added an additional example of Workers Sites with a modules format worker.

  This implements service environments + `wrangler dev`. Fairly simple, it just needed the right url when creating the edge preview token.

  Previously when running `wrangler dev` on multiple workers at the same time, you couldn't attach DevTools to both workers, since they were both listening on port 9229.
  With this PR, that behavior is improved -- you can now pass an `--inspector-port` flag to specify a port for DevTools to connect to on a per-worker basis, or
  if the option is omitted, wrangler will assign a random unused port for you.

  This "if no option is given, assign a random unused port" behavior has also been added to `wrangler dev --port`, so running `wrangler dev` on two
  workers at once should now "just work". Hopefully.

  The `preview` command is deprecated and not supported in this version of Wrangler.

  There was a common chunk of code across most commands that ensures a user is logged in, and retrieves an account ID. I'd resisted making this into an abstraction for a while. Now that the codebase is stable, and https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/537 removes some surrounding code there, I made an abstraction for this common code as `requireAuth()`.

  Currently, when creating a new project, we usually first have to create a directory before running `wrangler init`, since it defaults to creating the `wrangler.toml`, `package.json`, etc in the current working directory. This fix introduces an enhancement, where using the `wrangler init [name]` form creates a directory named `[name]` and initialises the project files inside it. This matches the usage pattern a little better, and still preserves the older behaviour when we're creating a worker inside existing projects.

  The configuration for a Worker is complicated since we can define different "environments", and each environment can have its own configuration.
  There is a default ("top-level") environment and then named environments that provide environment specific configuration.

  This is further complicated by the fact that there are three kinds of environment configuration:

  - **non-overridable**: these values are defined once in the top-level configuration, apply to all environments and cannot be overridden by an environment.
  - **inheritable**: these values can be defined at the top-level but can also be overridden by environment specific values.
    Named environments do not need to provide their own values, in which case they inherit the value from the top-level.
  - **non-inheritable**: these values must be explicitly defined in each environment if they are defined at the top-level.
    Named environments do not inherit such configuration and must provide their own values.

  All configuration values in `wrangler.toml` are optional and will receive a default value if not defined.

  This change adds more strict interfaces for top-level `Config` and `Environment` types,
  as well as validation and normalization of the optional fields that are read from `wrangler.toml`.

  We were warning if you were trying to develop a durable object with an unnamed worker.

  During `dev` and `publish`, we should resolve `wrangler.toml` starting from the entrypoint, and then working up from there. Currently, we start from the directory from which we call `wrangler`, this changes that behaviour to start from the entrypoint instead.

  (To implement this, I made one big change: Inside commands, we now have to explicitly read configuration from a path, instead of expecting it to 'arrive' coerced into a configuration object.)

Supported options:

  - `--status cancelled --status error` --> you can filter on `ok`, `error`, and `cancelled` to only tail logs that have that status
  - `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER:somevalue` --> you can filter on headers, including ones that have specific values (`"somevalue"`) or just that contain any header (e.g. `--header X-CUSTOM-HEADER` with no colon)
  - `--method POST --method PUT` --> filter on the HTTP method used to trigger the worker
  - `--search catch-this` --> only shows messages that contain the phrase `"catch-this"`. Does not (yet!) support regular expressions
  - `--ip self --ip 192.0.2.232` --> only show logs from requests that originate from the given IP addresses. `"self"` will be replaced with the IP address of the computer that sent the tail request.

  This formalises the logic we use to "guess"/infer what a worker's format is - either "modules" or "service worker". Previously we were using the output of the esbuild process metafile to infer this, we now explicitly do so in a separate step (esbuild's so fast that it doesn't have any apparent performance hit, but we also do a simpler form of the build to get this information).

  This also adds `--format` as a command line arg for `publish`.

  Adds support for "unsafe bindings", that is, bindings that aren't supported by wrangler, but are

  feature when desired. Note: these bindings may not work everywhere, and may break at any time.

  We open browser windows for a few things; during `wrangler dev`, and logging in. There are environments where this doesn't work as expected (like codespaces, stackblitz, etc).

  Now that we have `[[unsafe.bindings]]` (as of https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/411), we should use that for experimental features. This removes support for `[experimental_services]`, and adds a helpful message for how to rewrite their configuration.

  This error is temporary, until the internal teams that were using this rewrite their configs. We'll remove it before GA.

  What the error looks like -

  ```
  Error: The "experimental_services" field is no longer supported. Instead, use [[unsafe.bindings]] to enable experimental features. Add this to your wrangler.toml:

  [[unsafe.bindings]]
  name = "SomeService"

  This lands support for `[wasm_modules]` as defined by https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1677.

  wasm modules can be defined in service-worker format with configuration in wrangler.toml as -

  ```
  [wasm_modules]
  MYWASM = "./path/to/my-wasm.wasm"
  ```

  The module will then be available as the global `MYWASM` inside your code. Note that this ONLY makes sense in service-worker format workers (for now).

  (In the future, we MAY enable wasm module imports in service-worker format (i.e. `import MYWASM from './path/to/my-wasm.wasm'`) and global imports inside modules format workers.)

  This adds an error when we use an entry point that doesn't exist, either for `wrangler dev` or `wrangler publish`, and either via cli arg or `build.upload.main` in `wrangler.toml`.

  In e151223 we introduced a bug where the RouteKey was now an array rather than a simple URL string. When it got stringified into the routing object these were invalid.

  The api for fetching a kv value, unlike every other cloudflare api, returns just the raw value as a string (as opposed to the `FetchResult`-style json). However, our fetch utility tries to convert every api response to json before parsing it further. This leads to bugs like https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/359. The fix is to special case for `kv:key get`.

  - Don't rely on bash variables to configure tests
    The use of bash variables in the `npm test` script is not supported in Windows Powershell, causing CI on Windows to fail.
    These bash variables are used to override the API token and the Account ID.

    This change moves the control of mocking these two concepts into the test code, by adding `mockAccountId()` and `mockApiToken()` helpers.

    - The result is slightly more boilerplate in tests that need to avoid hitting the auth APIs.
    - But there are other tests that had to revert these environment variables. So the boilerplate is reduced there.

  - Sanitize command line for snapshot tests
    This change applies `normalizeSlashes()` and `trimTimings()` to command line outputs and error messages to avoid inconsistencies in snapshots.
    The benefit here is that authors do not need to keep adding them to all their snapshot tests.

  - Move all the helper functions into their own directory to keep the test directory cleaner.

  Previously in pages projects using advanced mode (a single `_worker.js` or `--script-path` file rather than a `./functions` folder), calling `pages dev` would quit without an error and not launch miniflare.

  There are several reasons to replace `node-fetch` with `undici`:

  - `undici`'s `fetch()` implementation is set to become node's standard `fetch()` implementation, which means we can just remove the dependency in the future (or optionally load it depending on which version of node is being used)
  - `node-fetch` pollutes the global type space with a number of standard types
  - we already bundle `undici` via `miniflare`/pages, so this means our bundle size could ostensibly become smaller.

  This replaces `node-fetch` with `undici`.

  - All instances of `import fetch from "node-fetch"` are replaced with `import {fetch} from "undici"`
  - `undici` also comes with spec compliant forms of `FormData` and `File`, so we could also remove `formdata-node` in `form_data.ts`
  - All the global types that were injected by `node-fetch` are now imported from `undici` (as well as some mistaken ones from `node:url`)
  - NOTE: this also turns on `skipLibCheck` in `tsconfig.json`. Some dependencies oddly depend on browser globals like `Request`, `Response` (like `@miniflare/core`, `jest-fetch-mock`, etc), which now fail because `node-fetch` isn't injecting those globals anymore. So we enable `skipLibCheck` to bypass them. (I'd thought `skipLibCheck` completely ignores 'third party' types, but that's not true - it still uses the module graph to scan types. So we're still typesafe. We should enable `strict` sometime to avoid `any`s, but that's for later.)
  - The bundle size isn't smaller because we're bundling 2 different versions of `undici`, but we'll fix that by separately upping the version of `undici` that miniflare bundles.

  - This adds `eslint-plugin-import` to enforce ordering of imports, and configuration for the same in `package.json`.
  - I also run `npm run check:lint -- --fix` to apply the configured order in our whole codebase.
  - This also needs a setting in `.vscode/settings.json` to prevent spurious warnings inside vscode. You'll probably have to restart your IDE for this to take effect. (re: https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2377#issuecomment-1024800026)

  (I'd also like to enforce using `node:` prefixes for node builtin modules, but that can happen later. For now I manually added the prefixes wherever they were missing. It's not functionally any different, but imo it helps the visual grouping.)

  This adds support for `*.wasm` modules into local mode for `wrangler dev`.

  In 'edge' mode, we create a javascript bundle, but wasm modules are uploaded to the preview server directly when making the worker definition form upload. However, in 'local' mode, we need to have the actual modules available to the bundle. So we copy the files over to the bundle path. We also pass appropriate `--modules-rule` directive to `miniflare`.

  I also added a sample wasm app to use for testing, created from a default `workers-rs` project.

  Previously we were caching all the `node_modules` files in the CI jobs and then running `npm install`. While this resulted in slightly improved install times on Ubuntu, it breaks on Windows because the npm workspace setup adds symlinks into node_modules, which the Github cache action cannot cope with.

  This change removes the `node_modules` caches (saving some time by not needing to restore them) and replaces `npm install` with `npm ci`.

  The `npm ci` command is actually designed to be used in CI jobs as it only installs the exact versions specified in the `package-lock.json` file, guaranteeing that for any commit we always have exactly the same CI job run, deterministically.

  It turns out that, on Ubuntu, using `npm ci` makes very little difference to the installation time (~30 secs), especially if there is no `node_modules` there in the first place.

  Unfortunately, MacOS is slower (~1 min), and Windows even worse (~2 mins)! But it is worth this longer CI run to be sure we have things working on all OSes.

  This fix passes the correct worker name to `syncAssets` during `wrangler dev`. This function uses the name to create the backing kv store for a Workers Sites definition, so it's important we get the name right.

  I also fixed the lint warning introduced in https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/321, to pass `props.enableLocalPersistence` as a dependency in the `useEffect` call that starts the "local" mode dev server.

* [#335](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/335) [`a417cb0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/a417cb0ad40708755e55bd299e282e6862aa155d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: prevent infinite loop when fetching a list of results

  When fetching a list of results from cloudflare APIs (e.g. when fetching a list of keys in a kv namespace), the api returns a `cursor` that a consumer should use to get the next 'page' of results. It appears this cursor can also be a blank string (while we'd only account for it to be `undefined`). By only accounting for it to be `undefined`, we were infinitely looping through the same page of results and never terminating. This PR fixes it by letting it be a blank string (and `null`, for good measure)

- [#332](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/332) [`a2155c1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/a2155c1ec65e271e4a5be1a19717b1aebdd647a5) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: wait for port to be available before creating a dev server

  When we run `wrangler dev`, we start a server on a port (defaulting to 8787). We do this separately for both local and edge modes. However, when switching between the two with the `l` hotkey, we don't 'wait' for the previous server to stop before starting the next one. This can crash the process, and we don't want that (of course). So we introduce a helper function `waitForPortToBeAvailable()` that waits for a port to be available before returning. This is used in both the local and edge modes, and prevents the bug right now, where switching between edge - local - edge crashes the process.

  (This isn't a complete fix, and we can still cause errors by very rapidly switching between the two modes. A proper long term fix for the future would probably be to hoist the proxy server hook above the `<Remote/>` and `<Local/>` components, and use a single instance throughout. But that requires a deeper refactor, and isn't critical at the moment.)

  We were adding text-like modules (i.e. `.txt`, `.html` and `.pem` files) as separate modules in the Worker definition, but this only really 'works' with the ES module Worker format. This commit changes that to inline the text-like files into the Worker bundle directly.

  We still have to do something similar with `.wasm` modules, but that requires a different fix, and we'll do so in a subsequent commit.

  This adds support for Workers Sites in local mode when running wrangler `dev`.

  This PR implements `wrangler secret` for `--local` mode. The implementation is simply a no-op, since we don't want to actually write secret values to disk (I think?).

  When we run `wrangler dev`, the session that we setup with the preview endpoint doesn't last forever, it dies after ignoring it for 5-15 minutes or so. The fix for this is to simply reconnect the server. So we use a state hook as a sigil, and add it to the dependency array of the effect that sets up the server, and simply change it every time the server closes.

  Fixes https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/197

  (In Wrangler v1, we used to restart the whole process, including uploading the worker again, making a new preview token, and so on. It looks like that they may not have been necessary.)

  We were using `--prefer-offline` when running `npm install` during `wrangler init`. The behaviour is odd, it doesn't seem to fetch from the remote when the cache isn't hit, which is not what I'm expecting. So we remove `--prefer-offline`.

  We were running custom builds as a regular command with `execa`. This would fail whenever we tried to run compound commands like `cargo install -q worker-build && worker-build --release` (via https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/236). The fix is to use `shell: true`, so that the command is run in a shell and can thus use bash-y syntax like `&&`, and so on. I also switched to using `execaCommand` which splits a command string into parts correctly by itself.

  This PR adds some enhancements/fixes to the `wrangler init` command.

  - doesn't overwrite `wrangler.toml` if it already exists
  - installs `wrangler` when creating `package.json`
  - offers to install `wrangler` into `package.json` even if `package.json` already exists
  - offers to install `@cloudflare/workers-types` even if `tsconfig.json` already exists
  - pipes stdio back to the terminal so there's feedback when it's installing npm packages

  This does have the side effect of making out tests slower. I added `--prefer-offline` to the `npm install` calls to make this a shade quicker, but I can't figure out a good way of mocking these. I'll think about it some more later. We should work on making the installs themselves quicker (re: https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/66)

  This PR also fixes a bug with our tests - `runWrangler` would catch thrown errors, and if we didn't manually verify the error, tests would pass. Instead, it now throws correctly, and I modified all the tests to assert on thrown errors. It seems like a lot, but it was just mechanical rewriting.

  This PR adds more special logic for some data types that get logged via `console` methods. Types like `Promise`, `Date`, `WeakMaps`, and some more, now get logged correctly (or at least, better than they used to).

  This PR also fixes a sinister bug - the `type` of the `ConsoleAPICalled` events don't match 1:1 with actual console methods (eg: `console.warn` message type is `warning`). This PR adds a mapping between those types and method names. Some methods don't seem to have a message type, I'm not sure why, but we'll get to them later.

  This adds an assertion error for making sure a `[site]` definition always has a `bucket` field.As a cleanup, I made some small fixes to the `Config` type definition, and modified the tests in `publish.test.ts` to use the config format when creating a `wrangler.toml` file.

  When we pass a non-js file as entry to esbuild, it generates a `.js` file. (which, is the whole job of esbuild, haha). So, given `<source>/index.ts`, it'll generate `<destination>/index.js`. However, when we try to 'find' the matching file to pass on as an input to creating the actual worker, we try to use the original file name inside the destination directory. At this point, the extension has changed, so it doesn't find the file, and hence we get the error that looks like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/var/folders/3f/fwp6mt7n13bfnkd5vl3jmh1w0000gp/T/tmp-61545-4Y5kwyNI8DGU/src/worker.ts'`

  The actual path to the destination file is actually the key of the block in `metafile.outputs` that matches the given output.entryPoint, so this PR simply rewrites the logic to use that instead.

  Any errors embedded in the response from the Cloudflare API were being lost, because `fetchInternal()` would throw on a non-200 response. This PR fixes that behaviour:

  - It doesn't throw on non-200 responses
  - It first gets the response text with `.text()` and converts it to an object with `JSON.parse`, so in case the api returns a non json response, we don't lose response we were sent.

  Unfortunately, because of the nature of this abstraction, we do lose the response `status` code and `statusText`, but maybe that's acceptable since we have richer error information in the payload. I considered logging the code and text to the terminal, but that may make it noisy.

  The `publish` command was failing when the entry-point was specified in the wrangler.toml file and the entry-point imported another file.

  This was because we were using the `metafile.inputs` to guess the entry-point file path. But the order in which the source-files were added to this object was not well defined, and so we could end up failing to find a match.

  This fix avoids this by using the fact that the `metadata.outputs` object will only contain one element that has the `entrypoint` property - and then using that as the entry-point path. For runtime safety, we now assert that there cannot be zero or multiple such elements.

  Watch the files in the wrangler workspace, and run the tests when anything changes:

  ```sh
  > npm run test-watch -w wrangler
  ```

  This will also run all the tests in a single process (rather than in parallel shards) and will increase the test-timeout to 50 seconds, which is helpful when debugging.

  We introduced some bugs in recent PRs

  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/196, we broke being able to pass an entrypoint directly to the cli. In this PR, I just reverted that fix. I'll reopen https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/78 and we'll tackle it again later. (cc @jgentes)
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/215, we broke being able to publish a script by just passing `--latest` or `--compatibility-data` in the cli. This PR fixes that by reading the correct argument when choosing whether to publish.
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/247, we broke how we made requests by passing headers to requests. This PR reverts the changes made in `cfetch/internal.ts`. (cc @petebacondarwin)
  - In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/244, we broke `dev` and it would immediately crash. This PR fixes the reference in `dev.tsx` that was breaking. (cc @petebacondarwin)

  This PR refactors how we setup the proxy server between the developer and the edge preview service during `wrangler dev`. Of note, we start the server immediately. We also buffer requests/streams and hold on to them, when starting/refreshing the token. This means a developer should never see `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error page, or have an older worker respond after making a change to the code. And when the token does get refreshed, we flush said streams/requests with the newer values, making the iteration process a lot smoother and predictable.

  Most API responses are JSON of the form:

  ```
  { result, success, errors, messages, result_info }
  ```

  where the `result` contains the actual response value.

  But some API responses only contain the result value.

  This change refactors the client-side fetch API to allow callers to specify what kind of response they expect.

  - A cli arg for adding a compatibility data, e.g `--compatibility_date 2022-01-05`
  - A shorthand `--latest` that sets `compatibility_date` to today's date. Usage of this flag logs a warning.
  - `latest` is NOT a config field in `wrangler.toml`.
  - In `dev`, when a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg, then we default to `--latest`.
  - In `publish` we error if a compatibility date is not available in either `wrangler.toml` or as a cli arg. Usage of `--latest` logs a warning.
  - We also accept compatibility flags via the cli, e.g: `--compatibility-flags formdata_parser_supports_files`

  - I've installed devtools-protocol, a convenient package that has the static types for the devtools protocol (duh) autogenerated from chrome's devtools codebase.
  - We now log messages and exceptions into the terminal directly, so you don't have to open devtools to see those messages.
  - Messages are now buffered until a devtools instance connects, so you won't lose any messages while devtools isn't connected.
  - We don't lose the connection on making changes to the worker, removing the need for the kludgy hack on the devtools side (where we refresh the whole page when there's a change)

  When doing a list request to the API, the server may respond with only a single page of results.
  In this case, it will also provide a `cursor` value in the `result_info` part of the response, which can be used to request the next page.
  This change implements this on the client-side so that we get all the results by requesting further pages when there is a cursor.

### Patch Changes

- 1fdcfe3: Subfolder Relative Pathing Fix issue #147
  The filename from args didn't handle relative paths passed in from users with scripts in subfolders.
  To handle the subfolder pathing a path.relative using cwd() to user input filepath to the filepath variable passed into Dev
- 0330ecf: Adds the Content-Type header when serving assets with `wrangler pages dev`. It guesses the mime-type based on the asset's file extension.
- eaf40e8: Improve the error message for bad `kv:namespace delete` commands
- 562d3ad: chore: enable eslint's no-shadow rule
- 9cef492: Adds the logic of @cloudflare/pages-functions-compiler directly into wrangler. This generates a Worker from a folder of functions.

  Also adds support for sourcemaps and automatically watching dependents to trigger a re-build.

- 3426c13: fix: prevent `useWorker`'s inifinite restarts during `dev`
- e9a1820: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.5`
- 7156e39: Pass bindings correctly to miniflare/child_process.spawn in `dev`, to prevent miniflare from erroring out on startup
- ce2d7d1: Add experimental support for worker-to-worker service bindings. This introduces a new field in configuration `experimental_services`, and serialises it when creating and uploading a worker definition. This is highly experimental, and doesn't work with `wrangler dev` yet.
- 072566f: Fixed KV getNamespaceId preview flag bug
- 5856807: Improve validation message for `kv:namespace create`

  Previously, if the user passed multiple positional arguments (which is invalid)
  the error message would suggest that these should be grouped in quotes.
  But this is also wrong, since a namespace binding name must not contain spaces.

- 34ad323: Refactor the way we convert configurations for bindings all the way through to the API where we upload a worker definition. This commit preserves the configuration structure (mostly) until the point we serialise it for the API. This prevents the way we use duck typing to detect a binding type when uploading, makes the types a bit simpler, and makes it easier to add other types of bindings in the future (notably, the upcoming service bindings.)

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- cea27fe: don't log file contents when writing via `kv:key put <key> --path <path>`
- b53cbc8: CI/CD
  - Release flow triggered on PR's closed
- 43e7a82: When using `wrangler pages dev`, enable source maps and log unhandled rejections
- c716abc: Error and exit if the `--type` option is used for the `init` command.

  The `--type` option is no longer needed, nor supported.

  The type of a project is implicitly javascript, even if it includes a wasm (e.g. built from rust).

  Projects that would have had the `webpack` type need to be configured separately to have a custom build.

- 3752acf: Add support for websockets in `dev`, i.e. when developing workers. This replaces the proxy layer that we use to connect to the 'edge' during preview mode, using the `faye-wesocket` library.
- c7bee70: Patches typing mismatches between us, undici and miniflare when proxying requests in pages dev, and also adds fallback 404 behavior which was missed
- 8b6c2d1: Add more fields to the `tsconfig.json` generated by `wrangler init`
- 78cd080: Custom builds for `dev` and `publish`
- cd05d20: import text file types into workers
- 1216fc9: Export regular functions from dialog.ts, pass tests (followup from https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/124)
- 6fc4c50: Display error message when unknown command is provided to the wrangler CLI.
- 23543fe: Allow the developer to exit `init` if there is already a toml file
- 1df6b0c: enable @typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises, pass lint+type check
- 3c5725f: CI/CD Cleanup
  - Removed the build step from tests, which should speed up the "Tests" Workflow.
  - Added a branch specific trigger for "Release", now the Workflow for "Release" should only work on PRs closed to `main`
  - Removed the "Changeset PR" Workflow. Now the "Release" Workflow will handle everything needed for Changesets.
- fb0eae7: support importing `.wasm` files / `workers-rs` support
- e928f94: Improve support for package exports conditionals, including "worker" condition
- 43e7a82: Upgrade `miniflare` to `2.0.0-rc.4`
- f473942: Replaces the static asset server with a more faithful simulation of what happens with a production Pages project.

  Also improves error handling and automatically opens the browser when running `wrangler pages dev`.

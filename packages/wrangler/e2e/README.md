# E2E tests

This folder contains e2e tests for Wrangler. The tests run in CI against a specific Cloudflare account.

You can also run these tests locally, but you'll need access to the `8d783f274e1f82dc46744c297b015a2f` (DevProd Testing) Cloudflare account. Once you have access, generate an API token for the account with the same scopes Wrangler requests.

You can then run the e2e test suite with the following commands (run them in root of the repo):

```zsh
pnpm i
pnpm build
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=8d783f274e1f82dc46744c297b015a2f CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<cloudflare-testing-api-token> WRANGLER="node --no-warnings $PWD/packages/wrangler/bin/wrangler.js" WRANGLER_IMPORT="$PWD/packages/wrangler/wrangler-dist/cli.js" pnpm --filter wrangler run test:e2e
```

> Make sure to replace `<cloudflare-testing-api-token>` with the actual API token you generated.

## How tests are written

These e2e tests are designed to run the actual Wrangler binary from a temporary directory containing test files.

There is a helper class `WranglerE2ETestHelper` that will create a context in which to run the Wrangler binary from a temporary directory.
This is defined in [packages/wrangler/e2e/helpers/e2e-wrangler-test.ts](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler/e2e/helpers/e2e-wrangler-test.ts).

There are two common patterns for using this class.

- Create a new instance inside each `it()` block so that the test is isolated from other tests in the file.
- Create an instance in a `describe()` block and then use it within the contained `it()` blocks can share the context.

There are four main properties of this class:

- `tmpPath`: the temporary directory created for this instance.
- `seed()`: used to write test files to the temporary directory.
- `run()`: used to run simple Wrangler commands, such as creating a KV namespace. It returns a promise to the result of the command.
- `runLongLived()`: used to run Wrangler commands that do not exit, such as `wrangler dev` and `wrangler tail`. It returns an object that can be used to monitor and interact with the running command.

### Example of simple command test

This example shows the helper class being shared across `it()` blocks, so that each test can build on the previous one.
It is using the `seed()` method to create test files in the temporary directory.
And then uses the `run()` method to execute simple Wrangler commands and get their output.

```ts
describe("uploading Worker versions", () => {
	const workerName = generateResourceName();
	const helper = new WranglerE2ETestHelper();

	beforeAll(async () => {
		await helper.seed({
			"wrangler.toml": dedent`
				name = "${workerName}"
				main = "src/index.ts"
				compatibility_date = "2023-01-01"
			`,
			"src/index.ts": dedent`
				export default {
					fetch(request) {
						return new Response("Hello World!")
					}
				}
			`,
			"package.json": dedent`
				{
					"name": "${workerName}",
					"version": "0.0.0",
					"private": true
				}
			`,
		});
	});
	it("deploy worker", async () => {
		await helper.run("wrangler deploy");
	});
	it("upload a version", async () => {
		const upload = await helper.run(
			`wrangler versions upload --message "Upload via e2e test" --tag "e2e-upload"  --x-versions`
		);
		// Check the output looks correct
		expect(normalize(upload.stdout)).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
			"Total Upload: xx KiB / gzip: xx KiB
			Worker Version ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
			Uploaded tmp-e2e-worker-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (TIMINGS)
			To deploy this version to production traffic use the command wrangler versions deploy --experimental-versions
			Changes to non-versioned settings (config properties 'logpush' or 'tail_consumers') take effect after your next deployment using the command wrangler versions deploy --experimental-versions
			Changes to triggers (routes, custom domains, cron schedules, etc) must be applied with the command wrangler triggers deploy --experimental-versions"
	`);
	});
});
```

### Example of long-lived command test

This test is checking the `wrangler dev` command will watch files and rebuild them when changed.
It is using an instance of the helper class within the `it()` block to isolate its files from other tests.
It is using the `seed()` method to create test files in the temporary directory.
And then uses the `runLongLived()` method to execute the `wrangler dev` command and then methods on the returned object to monitor the output from the command.
In particular the `worker.waitForReady()` and `worker.waitForReload()` commands watch the stream of output from the process for text that indicates that the Worker is ready to receive requests and that the Worker has been rebuilt, respectively.

```ts
it(`can modify worker during ${cmd}`, async () => {
	const helper = new WranglerE2ETestHelper();
	await helper.seed({
		"wrangler.toml": dedent`
			name = "worker"
			main = "src/index.ts"
			compatibility_date = "2023-01-01"
			compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

			[vars]
			KEY = "value"
		`,
		"src/index.ts": dedent`
			export default {
				fetch(request) {
					return new Response("Hello World!")
				}
			}`,
		"package.json": dedent`
			{
				"name": "worker",
				"version": "0.0.0",
				"private": true
			}
		`,
	});
	const worker = helper.runLongLived(cmd);

	const { url } = await worker.waitForReady();

	await expect(fetch(url).then((r) => r.text())).resolves.toMatchSnapshot();

	await helper.seed({
		"src/index.ts": dedent`
			export default {
				fetch(request, env) {
					return new Response("Updated Worker! " + env.KEY)
				}
			}
		`,
	});

	await worker.waitForReload();

	await expect(fetchText(url)).resolves.toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

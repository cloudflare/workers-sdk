/**
 * Name of the event that describes the kind event that happened.
 * - SchedulerPlaced: It's the first event that creates a Cloudchamber placement. It happens when the runtime was able to retrieve deployment resources and start verify everything is correct.
 * - NetworkingIPAssigned: It's sent when the Cloudchamber runtime has mapped the IP to the container.
 * - VMStarted: It's sent when the Cloudchamber has started the VM. However, it does not mean that the container is healthy.
 * - ImagePulled: It's sent when the Cloudchamber runtime has pulled the image successfully.
 * - ImagePullError: It's sent when the Cloudchamber runtime is having issues pulling image. The message and details have more information on what happened for debugging.
 * - VMFailedToStart: It's sent when the Cloudchamber runtime was unable to boot the VM.
 * - VMStopping: It's sent when the scheduler is stopping the VM.
 * - VMStopped: It's sent when the VM has finally exited.
 * - VMFailed: It's sent when the scheduling of the VM failed in the current location.
 * - RuntimeStartFailed: It's sent when the runtime had an internal error.
 * - SSHStarted: It's sent when the container has gained network connectivity and has opened the SSH port. This event is only sent when SSH keys are configured.
 * - CheckUpdate: Sent when the status of a health or readiness check changes. This may also affect the health status of the placement.

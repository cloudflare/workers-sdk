## Defining your new command in Wrangler

1. Create the command structure and define it in the registry.

First, create your namespaces and commands with the `createNamespace` and `createCommand` utilities. Namespaces are the prefix before the subcommand, eg. "wrangler kv" in "wrangler kv put".

```ts
import { createCommand, createNamespace } from "../core/create-command";
import { createKVNamespace } from "./helpers";

// Namespaces are the prefix before the subcommand
// eg "wrangler kv" in "wrangler kv put"
// eg "wrangler kv key" in "wrangler kv key put"
export const kvNamespace = createNamespace({
	metadata: {
		description: "Commands for interacting with Workers KV",
		status: "stable",
	},
});

// Every level of namespaces must be defined
// eg "wrangler kv key" in "wrangler kv key put"
export const kvKeyNamespace = createKVNamespace({
	metadata: {
		description: "Commands for interacting with Workers KV data",
		status: "stable",
	},
});

// Define the command args, implementation and metadata
export const kvKeyPutCommand = createCommand({
	metadata: {
		description: "Put a key-value pair into a Workers KV namespace",
		status: "stable",
	},
	args: {
		key: {
			type: "string",
			description: "The key to put into the KV namespace",
			demandOption: true,
		},
		value: {
			type: "string",
			description: "The value to put into the KV namespace",
			demandOption: true,
		},
		"namespace-id": {
			type: "string",
			description: "The namespace to put the key-value pair into",
		},
	},
	// the positionalArgs defines which of the args are positional and in what order
	positionalArgs: ["key", "value"],
	handler(args, ctx) {
		// implementation here
	},
});
```

Define your commands in the registry

```ts
import { kvKeyNamespace, kvKeyPutCommand, kvNamespace } from "./kv";

// ...

registry.define([
	{ command: "wrangler kv", definition: kvNamespace },
	{ command: "wrangler kv key", definition: kvKeyNamespace },
	{ command: "wrangler kv key put", definition: kvKeyPutCommand },
	// ...other kv commands here
]);
registry.registerNamespace("kv");
```

2. Command-specific (named + positional) args vs shared args vs global args

- Command-specific args are defined in the `args` field of the command definition. Command handlers receive these as a typed object automatically. To make any of these positional, add the key to the `positionalArgs` array.
- You can share args between commands by declaring a separate object and spreading it into the `args` field. Feel free to import from another file.
- Global args are shared across all commands and defined in `src/commands/global-args.ts` (same schema as command-specific args). They are available in every command handler.

3. Optionally, get a type for the args

You may want to pass your args to other functions. These functions will need to be typed. To get a type of your args, you can use `typeof command.args`.

4. Implement the command handler

A command handler is just a function that receives the `args` as the first param and `ctx` as the second param. This is where you will want to do API calls, I/O, logging, etc.

- API calls

Define API response type. Use `fetchResult` to make authenticated API calls. Import it from `src/cfetch` or use `ctx.fetchResult`. `fetchResult` will throw an error if the response is not 2xx.

```ts
type UploadResponse = {
	jwt?: string;
};

const res = await fetchResult<UploadResponse>(
	`/accounts/${accountId}/workers/assets/upload`,
	{
		method: "POST",
		headers: {
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
		},
		body: payload,
	}
);
```

- Logging

Do not use `console.*` methods to log. You must the `logger` singleton (imported from `src/logger`) or use `ctx.logger`.

- Error handling - UserError vs Error

These classes can be imported from `src/errors` or found on `ctx`, eg. `ctx.errors.UserError`.

Throw `UserError` for errors _caused_ by the user -- these are not sent to Sentry whereas regular `Error`s are and should be used for unexpected exceptions.

For example, if an exception was encountered because the user provided an invalid SQL statement in a D1 command, a `UserError` should be thrown. Whereas, if the D1 local DB crashed for another reason or there was a network error, a regular `Error` would be thrown.

Errors are caught at the top-level and formatted for the console.

## Best Practices

### Status / Deprecation

Status can be alpha, private-beta, open-beta, or stable. Breaking changes can freely be made in alpha or private-beta. Try avoid breaking changes in open-beta but are acceptable and should be called out in [a changeset](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#Changesets).

Stable commands should never have breaking changes.

### Changesets

Run `npx changesets` from the top of the repo. New commands warrant a "minor" bump. Please explain the functionality with examples.

For example:

```md
feat: implement the `wrangler versions deploy` command

This command allows users to deploy a multiple versions of their Worker.

Note: while in open-beta, the `--experimental-versions` flag is required.

For interactive use (to be prompted for all options), run:

- `wrangler versions deploy --x-versions`

For non-interactive use, run with CLI args (and `--yes` to accept defaults):

- `wrangler versions deploy --version-id $v1 --percentage 90 --version-id $v2 --percentage 10 --yes`
```

### Experimental Flags

If you have a stable command, new features should be added behind an experimental flag. By convention, these are named `--experimental-<feature-name>` and have an alias `--x-<feature-name>`. These should be boolean, defaulting to false (off by default).

To stabilise a feature, flip the default to true while keeping the flag to allow users to disable the feature with `--no-x-<feature-name>`.

After a validation period with no issues reported, you can mark the flag as deprecated and hidden, and remove all code paths using the flag.

### Documentation

Add documentation for the command in the [`cloudflare-docs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs) repo.

### PR Best Practices

- link to a ticket or issue
- add a description of what the PR does _and why_
- add a description of how to test the PR manually
- test manually with prelease (automatically published by PR bot)
- lint/check before push
- add "e2e" label if you need e2e tests to run

## Testing

### Unit/Integration Tests

These tests are in the `workers-sdk/packages/wrangler/src/__tests__/` directory.

Write these tests when you need to mock out the API or any module.

### Fixture Tests

These tests are in the `workers-sdk/fixtures/` directory.

Write these when you want to test your feature on a real Workers project.

### E2E Tests

Write these when you want to test your feature against the production API. Use describe.each to write the same test against multiple combinations of flags for your command.

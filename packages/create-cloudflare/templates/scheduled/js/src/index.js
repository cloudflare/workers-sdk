 *
 * - Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to start a development server
 * - Open a browser tab at http://localhost:8787/ to see your worker in action
 * - Run `npm run deploy` to publish your worker

		// A Cron Trigger can make requests to other endpoints on the Internet,
		// publish to a Queue, query a D1 Database, and much more.

		// We'll keep it simple and make an API call to a Cloudflare API:
		let resp = await fetch('https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/ips');
		let wasSuccessful = resp.ok ? 'success' : 'fail';

		// You could store this result in KV, write to a D1 Database, or publish to a Queue.
		// In this template, we'll just log the result:
		console.log(`trigger fired at ${event.cron}: ${wasSuccessful}`);

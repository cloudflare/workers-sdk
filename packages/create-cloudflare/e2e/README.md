# C3 E2E tests

This directory contains the e2e tests and helpers for C3.

## Running tests locally

There are three groups of tests:

- CLI - general tests against the C3 CLI tool, such as interactive prompts
- Workers - tests of the non-framework C3 templates such as `hello-world-durable-object-with-assets-ts`.
- Frameworks - tests of the framework C3 templates, such as `astro:workers`, `qwik:pages`, etc.

- To run all the tests locally you can do run the following from the root of the monorepo:

  ```bash
  pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare
  ```

  This command will actually run the `test:e2e` turbo task in the `create-cloudflare` package, which will also ensure that any dependencies have been built correctly first.

- To run just one group of tests (pass the group name to underlying command):

  ```bash
  pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare -- workers
  ```

  You can choose from `cli`, `workers` or `frameworks`.

The tests that run can be controlled by combining any of the following environment variables:

- `E2E_EXPERIMENTAL` - whether to run the tests in experimental mode - without this variable only non-experimental tests are run.
- `E2E_TEST_PM` + `E2E_TEST_PM_VERSION` - which package manager to simulate in the tests - without these variables the tests simulate `pnpm`.
- `E2E_RUN_DEPLOY_TESTS` - whether to ask C3 to deploy generated projects and run tests against the deployed version - if this is not set to `"true"`, generated projects are only tested locally.
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - the API token to use in tests that connect to Cloudflare - without this variable tests that require Cloudflare access are skipped.

### Running in experimental mode

C3 can be run in experimental mode, by passing `--experimental` to it as a CLI argument. By default the tests will run in non-experimental mode.
To run the tests in experimental mode, simply pass `E2E_EXPERIMENTAL=true` as an environment variable.

For example, to run the "cli" group in experimental mode:

```bash
E2E_EXPERIMENTAL=true pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare -- cli
```

> This experimental environment variable can be combined with the package manager environment variables below.

### Running against different package managers

C3 supports running sub-commands and installs using a range of package managers. By default the tests will run agains `pnpm`.
To run the tests using a different package manager, simply pass `E2E_TEST_PM` and `E2E_TEST_PM_VERSION` as environment variables.

For example, to run the "workers" group using yarn@1.22.22.

```bash
E2E_TEST_PM=yarn E2E_TEST_PM_VERSION=1.22.22 pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare -- workers
```

> These package manager environment variables can be combined with the experimental environment variable above.

### Running Workers templates individually

To run the e2e tests against a specific Worker template (or group of Worker template variants), provide the `E2E_WORKER_TEST_FILTER` environment variable.

Worker template names and their variants are delimited by colons (`:`).
If no colon is specified in the filter then all variants will be run for the matching template name.

For example to only run the python version of the `hello-world-durable-objects` template:

```bash
E2E_WORKER_TEST_FILTER=hello-world-durable-object:python pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare -- workers
```

To run all the `hello-world-with-assets` variants (`js`, `python`, `ts`):

```bash
E2E_WORKER_TEST_FILTER=hello-world-with-assets pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare -- workers
```

### Running Web frameworks templates individually

To run the e2e tests against a specific Web framework (or group of Worker template variants), provide the `E2E_FRAMEWORK_TEST_FILTER` environment variable.

Framework templates and their variants (`pages` or `workers`) are delimited by colons (`:`).
If no colon is specified in the filter then all variants will be run for the matching template.

For example to only run the `workers` version of the `react-router` framework:

```bash
E2E_FRAMEWORK_TEST_FILTER=react-router:workers pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare -- frameworks
```

To run all the `qwik` framework variants (`pages`, `workers`):

```bash
E2E_FRAMEWORK_TEST_FILTER=qwik pnpm test:e2e -F create-cloudflare -- frameworks
```

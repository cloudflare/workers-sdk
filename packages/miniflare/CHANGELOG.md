  The following dependency versions have been updated:

  | Dependency                | From          | To            |
  | ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
  | workerd                   | 1.20250525.0  | 1.20250604.0  |
  | @cloudflare/workers-types | ^4.20250525.0 | ^4.20250604.0 |

## 4.20250525.1

### Minor Changes

- [#9173](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/9173) [`fac2f9d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/fac2f9dfa67b9c9b3ab0979acbb79f8e020a9cfb) Thanks [@edmundhung](https://github.com/edmundhung)! - feat: export `getDefaultDevRegistryPath()` utility

  This provides a default XDG app-path for the Dev Registry, which can be used to set the `unsafeDevRegistryPath` option in Miniflare and will be used by both Wrangler and @cloudflare/vite-plugin.

- [#9313](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/9313) [`92719a5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/92719a535bf6bae9d660a05d5c8f8823004929c5) Thanks [@edmundhung](https://github.com/edmundhung)! - feat: add Dev Registry support

  This change introduces two new options to support cross-process service bindings, durable objects and tail consumers via a file-system based registry, with backward compatibility to Wrangler’s implementation:

  - **`unsafeDevRegistryPath`** (`string`): Filesystem path to the Dev Registry directory.
  - **`unsafeDevRegistryDurableObjectProxy`** (`boolean`): When enabled, exposes internal Durable Objects to other local dev sessions and allows Workers to connect to external Durable Objects.

  Example usage:

  ```ts
  import { Miniflare } from "miniflare";

  const mf = new Miniflare({
  	scriptPath: "./dist/worker.js",
  	unsafeDevRegistryPath: "/registry",
  	unsafeDevRegistryDurableObjectProxy: true,
  	// ...other options
  });
  ```

This makes it possible to override the messages printed on server start.

- [#9376](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/9376) [`fdae3f7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/fdae3f7665a5cd3b5e25c9de19156ecd54618a7c) Thanks [@jamesopstad](https://github.com/jamesopstad)! - Add support for Node.js style custom handlers for service bindings and outbound services. This makes it easier to integrate Miniflare with existing Node.js middleware and libraries as `req` and `res` objects can be used directly.

  ```js
  new Miniflare({
  	serviceBindings: {
  		CUSTOM: {
  			node: (req, res) => {
  				res.end(`Hello world`);
  			},
  		},

  The KV plugin previously configured both KV namespace and secrets store bindings with the same service name but different persistence paths, causing conflicts when both were defined. This change copies the KV binding implementation into the secrets store plugin and customizes its service name to prevent collisions.

  In v4.15.0, Miniflare began stripping the `CF-Connecting-IP` header via a global outbound service, which led to a TCP connection regression due to a bug in Workerd. This PR patches the `fetch` API to strip the header during local `wrangler dev` sessions as a temporary workaround until the underlying issue is resolved.

  While Node.js will start the message port automatically when a `message` event listener is added,
  this diverges from the standard Web API for message ports, which require you to explicitly start

### Patch Changes

- [#8357](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/8357) [`ff26dc2`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/ff26dc20210c193b9e175f5567277d5584bdf657) Thanks [@dario-piotrowicz](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz)! - feat: add new `unsafeInspectorProxy` option to miniflare

  Add a new `unsafeInspectorProxy` option to the miniflare worker options, if
  at least one worker has the option set then miniflare will establish a proxy
  between itself and workerd for the v8 inspector APIs which exposes only the
  requested workers to inspector clients. The inspector proxy communicates through
  miniflare's `inspectorPort` and exposes each requested worker via a path comprised
  of the worker's name

  example:

  ```js
  import { Miniflare } from "miniflare";

  const mf = new Miniflare({
  	// the inspector proxy will be accessible through port 9229
  	inspectorPort: 9229,
  	workers: [
  		{
  			name: "worker-a",
  			scriptPath: "./worker-a.js",
  			// enable the inspector proxy for worker-a
  			unsafeInspectorProxy: true,
  		},
  		{
  			name: "worker-b",
  			scriptPath: "./worker-b.js",
  			// worker-b is not going to be proxied
  		},
  		{
  			name: "worker-c",
  			scriptPath: "./worker-c.js",
  			// enable the inspector proxy for worker-c
  			unsafeInspectorProxy: true,
  		},
  	],
  });
  ```

  In the above example an inspector proxy gets set up which exposes `worker-a` and `worker-b`,
  inspector clients can discover such workers via `http://localhost:9229` and communicate with
  them respectively via `ws://localhost:9229/worker-a` and `ws://localhost:9229/worker-b`

  Note: this API is experimental, thus it's not being added to the public documentation and
  it's prefixed by `unsafe`

Instead, use the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag. This includes the functionality from legacy `node_compat` polyfills and natively implemented Node.js APIs. See https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs for more information.

  If you need to replicate the behaviour of the legacy `node_compat` feature, refer to https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/migration/update-v3-to-v4/ for a detailed guide.

  This commit implements a very basic Proxy Worker skeleton, and wires it in the "pipeline" miniflare creates for assets. This Worker will be incrementally worked on, but for now, the current implementation will forward all incoming requests to the Router Worker, thus leaving the current assets behaviour in local dev, the same.

  This is an experimental feature available under the `--x-assets-rpc` flag: `wrangler dev --x-assets-rpc`.

  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/7251 added support for running multiple Workers in one `wrangler dev`/miniflare session. e.g. `wrangler dev -c wrangler.toml -c ../worker2/wrangler.toml`, which among other things, allowed cross-service RPC to Durable Objects.

  However this did not work in the same way as production when there was a Worker with assets - this PR should fix that.

  This patch cleans up warnings we were seeing when doing a full build. Specifically:

  - fixtures/remix-pages-app had a bunch of warnings about impending features that it should be upgraded to, so I did that. (tbh this one needs a full upgrade of packages, but we'll get to that later when we're upgrading across the codebase)
  - updated `@microsoft/api-extractor` so it didn't complain that it didn't match the `typescript` version (that we'd recently upgraded)
  - it also silenced a bunch of warnings when exporting types from `wrangler`. We'll need to fix those, but we'll do that when we work on unstable_dev etc.
  - workers-playground was complaining about the size of the bundle being generated, so I increased the limit on it

  	const { functionsFactory } = await mf.getBindings<Env>();
  	const fn = functionsFactory.getFunction();
  	const functionResult = fn();

  This also works with the native workers RPC mechanism, allowing users to
  return functions in their RPC code.

  Previously, Miniflare would pass through the incoming `Accept-Encoding` header to your Worker code. This change ensures this header is always set to `Accept-Encoding: br, gzip` for incoming requests to your Worker. The original value of `Accept-Encoding` will be stored in `request.cf.clientAcceptEncoding`. This matches [deployed behaviour](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/http-request-headers/#accept-encoding).

  Fixes #5246

### Minor Changes

- [#5215](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/5215) [`cd03d1d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/cd03d1d3fa6e733faa42e5abb92f37637503b327) Thanks [@GregBrimble](https://github.com/GregBrimble)! - feature: customisable unsafe direct sockets entrypoints

  Previously, Miniflare provided experimental `unsafeDirectHost` and `unsafeDirectPort` options for starting an HTTP server that pointed directly to a specific Worker. This change replaces these options with a single `unsafeDirectSockets` option that accepts an array of socket objects of the form `{ host?: string, port?: number, entrypoint?: string, proxy?: boolean }`. `host` defaults to `127.0.0.1`, `port` defaults to `0`, `entrypoint` defaults to `default`, and `proxy` defaults to `false`. This allows you to start HTTP servers for specific entrypoints of specific Workers. `proxy` controls the [`Style`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/blob/af35f1e7b0f166ec4ca93a8bf7daeacda029f11d/src/workerd/server/workerd.capnp#L780-L789) of the socket.

  Note these sockets set the `capnpConnectHost` `workerd` option to `"miniflare-unsafe-internal-capnp-connect"`. `external` `serviceBindings` will set their `capnpConnectHost` option to the same value allowing RPC over multiple `Miniflare` instances. Refer to https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/1757 for more information.

  This change allows service bindings to bind to a named export of another Worker using designators of the form `{ name: string | typeof kCurrentWorker, entrypoint?: string }`. Previously, you could only bind to the `default` entrypoint. With this change, you can bind to any exported entrypoint.

  ```ts

  Previously, if a string `script` option was specified with `modules: true` but without a corresponding `scriptPath`, all `import`s were forbidden. This change relaxes that restriction to allow imports of built-in `node:*`, `cloudflare:*` and `workerd:*` modules without a `scriptPath`.

  Currently trying to read multiple R2 streams in parallel (via `Promise.all` for example) leads to deadlock which prevents any of the target streams from being read. This is caused by the underlying implementation only allowing a single HTTP connection to the Workers runtime at a time. This change fixes the issue by allowing multiple parallel HTTP connections.

  Previously, if Miniflare was configured to start on a `host` that wasn't `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `*`, `::`, or `0.0.0.0`, calls to `Miniflare` API methods relying on the magic proxy (e.g. `getKVNamespace()`, `getWorker()`, etc.) would fail. This change ensures `workerd` is always accessible to Miniflare's internals. This also fixes `wrangler dev` when using local network address such as `192.168.0.10` with the `--ip` flag.

  This change adds a new `Miniflare`-typed parameter to function-valued service binding handlers. This provides easy access to the correct bindings when re-using service functions across instances.

  Miniflare has lots of file-path-valued options (e.g. `scriptPath`, `kvPersist`, `textBlobBindings`). Previously, these were always resolved relative to the current working directory before being used. This change adds a new `rootPath` shared, and per-worker option for customising this behaviour. Instead of resolving relative to the current working directory, Miniflare will now resolve path-valued options relative to the closest `rootPath` option. Paths are still resolved relative to the current working directory if no `rootPath`s are defined. Worker-level `rootPath`s are themselves resolved relative to the shared `rootPath` if defined.

  import { Miniflare } from "miniflare";

  Previously, if you wanted to create a service binding to the current Worker, you'd need to know the Worker's name. This is usually possible, but can get tricky when dealing with many Workers. This change adds a new `kCurrentWorker` symbol that can be used instead of a Worker name in `serviceBindings`. `kCurrentWorker` always points to the Worker with the binding.

  ```js
  import { kCurrentWorker, Miniflare } from "miniflare";

  Previously, Miniflare would resolve relative `scriptPath`s against `moduleRoot` multiple times resulting in incorrect paths and module names. This would lead to `can't use ".." to break out of starting directory` `workerd` errors. This change ensures Miniflare uses `scriptPath` as is, and only resolves it relative to `modulesRoot` when computing module names. Note this bug didn't affect service workers. This allows you to reference a modules `scriptPath` outside the working directory with something like:

  ```js
  const mf = new Miniflare({
  	modules: true,
  	modulesRoot: "..",
  	scriptPath: "../worker.mjs",
  });

  Previously, Miniflare's `fetch()` would throw an error if the `Upgrade: websocket` header was set, and a non-WebSocket response was returned from the origin. This change ensures the non-WebSocket response is returned from `fetch()` instead, with `webSocket` set to `null`. This allows the caller to handle the response as they see fit.

  Miniflare uses Zod for validating options. Previously, Miniflare inferred `*Options` from the _output_ types of its Zod schemas, rather than the _input_ types. In most cases, these were the same. However, the `hyperdrives` option has different input/output types, preventing these from being type checked correctly.

  In https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4812 we tried to fix the Origin headers to match the Host header but were overzealous and rewrote Origin headers for external origins (outside of the proxy server's origin).

  This is now fixed, and moreover we rewrite any headers that refer to the proxy server on the request with the configured host and vice versa on the response.

  This should ensure that CORS is not broken in browsers when a different host is being simulated based on routes in the Wrangler configuration.

  The `wrangler dev` command puts the Worker under test behind a proxy server.
  This proxy server should be transparent to the client and the Worker, which
  means that the `Request` arriving at the Worker with the correct `url` property,
  and `Host` and `Origin` headers.
  Previously we fixed the `Host` header but missed the `Origin` header which is
  only added to a request under certain circumstances, such as cross-origin requests.

  This change fixes the `Origin` header as well, so that it is rewritten, when it exists,
  to use the `origin` of the `url` property.

  Some full-stack frameworks, such as Next.js, check that the Host header for a server
  side action request matches the host where the application is expected to run.

  In `wrangler dev` we have a Proxy Worker in between the browser and the actual User Worker.
  This Proxy Worker is forwarding on the request from the browser, but then the actual User
  Worker is running on a different host:port combination than that which the browser thinks
  it should be on. This was causing the framework to think the request is malicious and blocking
  it.

  Now we update the request's Host header to that passed from the Proxy Worker in a custom `MF-Original-Url`
  header, but only do this if the request also contains a shared secret between the Proxy Worker
  and User Worker, which is passed via the `MF-Proxy-Shared-Secret` header. This last feature is to
  prevent a malicious website from faking the Host header in a request directly to the User Worker.

  When storing data in KV, Cache and R2, Miniflare uses both an SQL database and separate blob store. When writing a key/value pair, a blob is created for the new value and the old blob for the previous value (if any) is deleted. A few months ago, we introduced a change that prevented old blobs being deleted for KV and Cache. R2 was unaffected. This shouldn't have caused any problems, but could lead to persistence directories growing unnecessarily as they filled up with garbage blobs. This change ensures garbage blobs are deleted.

  Note existing garbage will not be cleaned up. If you'd like to do this, download this Node script (https://gist.github.com/mrbbot/68787e19dcde511bd99aa94997b39076). If you're using the default Wrangler persistence directory, run `node gc.mjs kv .wrangler/state/v3/kv <namespace_id_1> <namespace_id_2> ...` and `node gc.mjs cache .wrangler/state/v3/cache default named:<cache_name_1> named:<cache_name_2> ...` with each of your KV namespace IDs (not binding names) and named caches.

  `Host` and `Origin` headers are now checked when connecting to the inspector and Miniflare's magic proxy. If these don't match what's expected, the request will fail.

  When using Workers Sites with a module worker, the asset manifest must be imported from the `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST` virtual module. Miniflare provided this module, but also erroneously added `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST` to the `env` object too. Whilst this didn't break anything locally, it could cause users to develop Workers that ran locally, but not when deployed. This change ensures `env` doesn't contain `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST`.

### Minor Changes

- [#4348](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4348) [`be2b9cf5`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/be2b9cf5a9395cf7385f59d2e1ec3131dae3d87f) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - feat: add support for wrapped bindings

  This change adds a new `wrappedBindings` worker option for configuring
  `workerd`'s [wrapped bindings](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/blob/bfcef2d850514c569c039cb84c43bc046af4ffb9/src/workerd/server/workerd.capnp#L469-L487).
  These allow custom bindings to be written as JavaScript functions accepting an
  `env` parameter of "inner bindings" and returning the value to bind. For more
  details, refer to the [API docs](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/blob/main/packages/miniflare/README.md#core).

By default, if this option is not provided, the previous behaviour is retained which splits the streams into lines and calls `console.log`/`console.error`.

* [#4322](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4322) [`8a25b7fb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/8a25b7fba94c8e9989412bc266ada307975f182d) Thanks [@dario-piotrowicz](https://github.com/dario-piotrowicz)! - add `unsafeEvalBinding` option

  Add option to leverage the newly introduced [`UnsafeEval`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd/pull/1338) workerd binding API,
  such API is used to evaluate javascript code at runtime via the provided `eval` and `newFunction` methods.

  The API, for security reasons (as per the [workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-standards/#javascript-standards)), is not to be use in production but it is intended for local purposes only such as local testing.

  To use the binding you need to specify a string value for the `unsafeEvalBinding`, such will be the name of the `UnsafeEval` bindings that will be made available in the workerd runtime.

  For example the following code shows how to set the binding with the `UNSAFE_EVAL` name and evaluate the `1+1` string:

  ```ts
  const mf = new Miniflare({
  	log,
  	modules: true,
  	script: `
        export default {
            fetch(req, env, ctx) {
                const two = env.UNSAFE_EVAL.eval('1+1');
                return new Response('two = ' + two); // returns 'two = 2'
            }
        }
    `,
  	unsafeEvalBinding: "UNSAFE_EVAL",
  });
  ```

  Miniflare 3 doesn't include a CLI anymore, but should log a useful error stating this when running `npx miniflare`. We had a script for this, but it wasn't correctly hooked up. :facepalm: This change makes sure the required `bin` entry exists.

- [#4321](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/4321) [`29a59d4e`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/commit/29a59d4e72e3ae849474325c5c93252a3f84af0d) Thanks [@mrbbot](https://github.com/mrbbot)! - fix: ensure `Mutex` doesn't report itself as drained if locked

  Previously, Miniflare's `Mutex` implementation would report itself as drained
  if there were no waiters, regardless of the locked state. This bug meant that
  if you called but didn't `await` `Miniflare#setOptions()`, future calls to
  `Miniflare#dispatchFetch()` (or any other asynchronous `Miniflare` method)
  wouldn't wait for the options update to apply and the runtime to restart before
  sending requests. This change ensures we wait until the mutex is unlocked before
  reporting it as drained.

  Previously on exit, Miniflare would attempt to remove its temporary directory
  before shutting down `workerd`. This could lead to `EBUSY` errors on Windows.
  This change ensures we shutdown `workerd` before removing the directory.
  Since we can only clean up on a best effort basis when exiting, it also catches
  any errors thrown when removing the directory, in case the runtime doesn't
  shutdown fast enough.

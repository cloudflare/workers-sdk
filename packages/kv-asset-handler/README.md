## Usage

Currently this exports a single function `getAssertFromKV` that maps `Request` objects to KV Assets, and throws an `Error` if it cannot.

```js
import { getAssetFromKV } from "@cloudflare/kv-asset-handlers";
```

`getAssetFromKV` is a function that takes a `Request` object and returns a `Response` object if the request matches an asset in KV, otherwise it will throw an `Error`.

### Example

This example checks for the existence of a value in KV, and returns it if it's there, and returns a 404 if it is not. It also serves index.html from `/`.

```js
import { getAssetFromKV } from "@cloudflare/kv-asset-handlers";

addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  let url = new URL(request.url);
  if (url.pathname === "/") {
    request = new Request(`${url}/index.html`)
  }
  try {
    return await getAssetFromKV(request)
  } catch (e) {
    return new Response(`"${url.pathname}" not found`, { status: 404, statusText: "not found" })
  }
}
```

You could also implement this differently in conjunctin with other worker logic

```js
  if (request.url.contains("api")) {
    return new Response("api response")
  }
  let assetWorker = new AssetWorker();
  if (await assetWorker.condition(request) {
    let response = await assetWorker.handler(request)
    // do something with htmlRewriter
    return response
  }
  return new Response("not found", { status: 404 })
```

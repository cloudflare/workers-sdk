// RateLimiter implements a Durable Object that tracks the frequency of messages from a particular
// source and decides when messages should be dropped because the source is sending too many
// messages.
//
// We utilize this in ChatRoom, above, to apply a per-IP-address rate limit. These limits are
// global, i.e. they apply across all chat rooms, so if a user spams one chat room, they will find
// themselves rate limited in all other chat rooms simultaneously.

    // past, i.e. the IP can send a message now.

  }

  // Our protocol is: POST when the IP performs an action, or GET to simply read the current limit.
  // Either way, the result is the number of seconds to wait before allowing the IP to perform its
  // next action.

        // which point all further calls fail. This guarantee makes a lot of complex interaction

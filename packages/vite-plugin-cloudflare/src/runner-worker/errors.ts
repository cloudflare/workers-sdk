// - Errors that occur in named entrypoints, auxiliary Workers etc. will display in stack traces as occurring in the default export of the entry Worker
// - If an error occurs in a named entrypoint or auxiliary Worker and the `fetch` handler in the default export of the entry Worker returns the response from the binding directly then the stack trace will be incorrect

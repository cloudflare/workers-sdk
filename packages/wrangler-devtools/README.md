# Wrangler Devtools Pages Project

This package contains a Workers specific version of Chrome Devtools that is used by the Wrangler dev command. It is a customized fork of Chrome DevTools specifically tailored for debugging Cloudflare Workers. This package provides Worker-specific functionality through carefully maintained patches on top of Chrome DevTools.

## Overview

This package is used across multiple Cloudflare products:

- Workers Playground (`workers-playground`)
- Quick Editor (`@cloudflare/quick-edit`)
- Wrangler CLI via the `InspectorProxy`

## Features

Our customized DevTools implementation provides:

- Source code viewing and live updates
- Network request inspection
- Worker-specific UI optimizations

## Development

We maintain this fork by applying patches on top of Chrome DevTools. These patches need to be periodically rebased as Chrome DevTools evolves.

**Key Development Tasks:**

- Generating patches from our customizations
- Rebasing patches onto new Chrome DevTools versions
- Testing functionality across all integration points

## Updating DevTools

We perform quarterly updates to stay current with upstream Chrome DevTools. The update process involves:

1. Cloning the devtools-frontend repo
2. Applying our existing patches
3. Rebasing onto the latest Chrome DevTools
4. Regenerating patches
5. Thorough testing across all integration points

**For detailed instructions on updating DevTools, please refer to our internal documentation on keeping devtools up-to-date.**

## Testing

Two methods are available for testing updates:

**Local Development:**

- Build and serve DevTools locally
- Test against local Playground instance
- Make targeted fixes as needed

**Preview Builds:**

On any pull request to the repo on GitHub, you can add labels to trigger preview builds of both the DevTools frontend, and the Playground. This is useful because it will allow you to manually test your changes in a live environment, and with one-click.

There are two labels you can use:

- `preview:wrangler-devtools` - this will trigger the DevTools preview
- `preview:wrangler-playground` - this will trigger the Playground preview

If you add **both** labels, Playground will embed the DevTools preview, so you can test them together.

Once the previews are built, you will see a comment on the PR with links to the live URLs.

## Acceptance Criteria

Our DevTools implementation must maintain full functionality across:

- Console operations (logging, errors, filters)
- Source code viewing and debugging
- Network request inspection
- Worker-specific UI customizations

## Contributing

When making changes:

- Keep patches minimal and targeted
- Prefer CSS-based UI modifications
- Test thoroughly across all integration points
- Document any new patches or modifications

## Deployment

Deployments are managed by GitHub Actions:

- deploy-pages-previews.yml:
  - Runs on any PR that has the `preview:wrangler-devtools` label.
  - Deploys a preview, which can then be accessed via [https://<SHA>.cloudflare-devtools.pages.dev/].
- changesets.yml:
  - Runs when a "Version Packages" PR, containing a changeset that touches this package, is merged to `main`.
  - Deploys this package to production, which can then be accessed via [https://cloudflare-devtools.pages.dev/].

    /**
     * Handles keydown event on panel itself for handling expand/collapse all shortcut
     *
     * We use `event.code` instead of `event.key` here to check whether the shortcut is triggered.
     * The reason is, `event.key` is dependent on the modification keys, locale and keyboard layout.
     * Usually it is useful when we care about the character that needs to be printed.
     *
     * However, our aim in here is to assign a shortcut to the physical key combination on the keyboard
     * not on the character that the key combination prints.
     *
     * For example, `Cmd + [` shortcut in global shortcuts map to focusing on previous panel.
     * In Turkish - Q keyboard layout, the key combination that triggers the shortcut prints `ÄŸ`
     * character. Whereas in Turkish - Q Legacy keyboard layout, the shortcut that triggers focusing
     * on previous panel prints `[` character. So, if we use `event.key` and check
     * whether it is `[`, we break the shortcut in Turkish - Q keyboard layout.

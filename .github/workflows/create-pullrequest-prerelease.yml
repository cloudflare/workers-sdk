        # We use the `@actions/artifact` package in the prerelease scripts below.
        # This is meant to be used from custom JavaScript actions, rather than
        # workflow `run` steps. This means it expects `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`
        # and `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` environment variables to be set. We'd like
        # to retain separation between the different stages of pre-releasing,
        # and easily pass environment variables to the build. Therefore, we use
        # this stub action that exposes the `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` and
        # `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` action-specific environment variables as
        # `GITHUB_ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` global
        # environment variables. These can be passed via `env` to `run` steps
        # that use `@actions/artifact`.

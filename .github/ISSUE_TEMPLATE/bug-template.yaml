        ### Observed behavior
        Please describe.

        ### Expected behavior
        Please describe.

        ### Steps to reproduce
        Please provide the following:
        - A minimal working subset of your worker code
        - A minimal working subset of your `wrangler.toml`
        - Commands used to start your local dev server, including custom env and cli args
        - Steps to be performed in the browser, curl commands, or a test we can run that reliably fails (at least a percent of the time)

        A git repo we can clone and run a test suite on, or which has a README with step-by-step instructions, is even better. In this case, please use the field below to provide a link to the minimal repro.

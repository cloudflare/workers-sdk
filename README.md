Cloudflare Worker: Itty Router Template

[![Deploy with Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/templates/worker-router)

This template leverages the [`itty-router`](https://github.com/kwhitley/itty-router) package, demonstrating a simple way to implement routing within Cloudflare Workers. Utilize this for creating modular and easy-to-navigate applications.

### Template Structure

The primary script of this template is located in [`index.js`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template-router/blob/master/index.js), which contains the routing logic and example routes.

Setup and Deployment

Creating the Project

To set up your project directory using this template, execute one of the following commands depending on your package manager preference:

```sh
$ npx wrangler generate my-project worker-itty-router
# or
$ yarn wrangler generate my-project worker-itty-router
# or
$ pnpm wrangler generate my-project worker-itty-router
```

These commands create a new directory named `my-project` with all necessary files to start a new Cloudflare Worker project using the Itty Router.

Configuration

Before deploying, edit the `wrangler.toml` file to include your Cloudflare `account_id`. This file configures your project settings and deployment options.

Publishing Your Worker

When your project is configured and ready for deployment, use the following command to publish:

```sh
$ npm run deploy
# or
$ yarn run deploy
# or
$ pnpm run deploy
```

For detailed guidance on configuring and deploying your worker, please refer to the [Cloudflare Workers Getting Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/getting-started).

# Worker-Router Template for Cloudflare Workers

The `worker-router` template provides a structured starting point for building applications on Cloudflare Workers using the `itty-router` library. This template is part of the broader Cloudflare Workers SDK, designed to help developers build and deploy serverless applications at the edge.

## Features

- **Intuitive Routing**: Implements `itty-router` for straightforward routing capabilities.
- **Serverless Performance**: Leverages Cloudflare's global network for low-latency responses.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Structured to grow with your application's needs.

## Prerequisites

To use this template, you should have the following:

- Node.js installed (version 12 or later).
- A Cloudflare Workers account.
- The `wrangler` CLI installed on your local machine.

## Getting Started

Step 3: Generate Project From Template
Generate a new project using this template:
npx wrangler generate my-worker-app https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/templates/worker-router

Replace my-worker-app with the name of your project's directory.

Step 4: Configure Your Project
Edit the wrangler.toml file in your new project directory to include your Cloudflare account ID.

Step 5: Develop Locally

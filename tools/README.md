# Continuous Integration (CI) tools

Tools for helping with CI

- `deployments/deploy-non-npm-packages()` - Deploy all packages that had updates but are not deployed to npm automatically by the changesets tooling.
  This is used by the changesets.yml GitHub workflow to deploy non-npm packages (e.g. Workers and Pages projects).

- `deployments/ensure-fixtures-are-not-deployable.ts` - Ensures that we don't accidentally create git tags and releases for fixtures by someone inadvertently adding a version to their package.json or making them non-private.
  Used by test-and-check.yml GitHub Action workflows, as part of the `check` npm script.

- `deployments/validate-changesets.ts` - Validate that changesets are formatted correctly.
  Used by the changesets.yml and test-and-check.yml GitHub Action workflows.

- `dependabot/generate-dependabot-pr-changesets.ts` - Generates and commits a changeset for a Dependabot PR.
  Used by the c3-dependabot-versioning-prs.yml and miniflare-dependabot-versioning-prs.yml GitHub Action workflows.

- `e2e/e2eCleanup.ts` - Ensures that any orphaned Pages projects and Workers that were left behind from e2e tests are deleted.

- `e2e/runIndividualE2EFiles.ts` - Used to shard the e2e tests into separately cache-able Turbo runs, which helps with flakey tests.

- `test/run-test-file.ts` - Used by in VS Code configuration to launch a debug session to run a single test file.

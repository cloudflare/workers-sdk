# ⚡️ pages-workerjs-and-functions-app

`pages-workerjs-and-functions-app` is a test fixture that sets up an [Advanced Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/#advanced-mode) ⚡️Pages project that also includes a `/functions` directory. This fixture is meant to test that for such projects, the single worker script provided by users will
always take precedence over the `functions` directory.

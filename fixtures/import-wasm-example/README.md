# import-wasm-example

`import-wasm-example` is a test fixture that imports a `wasm` file from `import-wasm-static`, testing npm module resolution with wrangler imports.
It also imports a file that isn't technically exported from `import-wasm-static`, testing more traditional node module resolution.

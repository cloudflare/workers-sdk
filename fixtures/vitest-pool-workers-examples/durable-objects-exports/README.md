# 📌 durable-objects-exports

This Worker mirrors the simple [`durable-objects`](../durable-objects/) fixture, but configures its Durable Objects via the declarative [`exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/reference/durable-object-exports) field in `wrangler.jsonc` instead of the legacy `migrations` array.

`Counter` is also declared as a regular binding under `durable_objects.bindings`. `UnboundCounter` has no binding and is reachable only via `ctx.exports.UnboundCounter` from inside the Worker — both forms must work for `exports` to be a full replacement for `migrations`.

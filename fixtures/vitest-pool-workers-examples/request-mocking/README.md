# ðŸ¤¹ request-mocking

This Worker rewrites the host of all incoming requests to `cloudflare.com` then forwards the request on. Tests demonstrate declarative mocking with `fetchMock` from the `cloudflare:test` module, and imperative mocks of `globalThis.fetch()`. Note mocking WebSocket requests is only supported with imperative mocking.

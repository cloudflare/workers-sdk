# ðŸ“¦ kv-r2-caches

This Worker makes use of KV and R2 bindings, along with the Cache API. The Worker accepts `GET`/`PUT` requests to `/kv/...` and `/r2/...`. Request URLs are used as keys. `PUT` requests store their body at the corresponding key. `GET` requests read the value at the key. R2 reads are cached using the Cache API.

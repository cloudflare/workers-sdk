fix: Don't send auth header in signed requests for prerelease registry blobs

GitHub returns an archive_download_url in responses for Actions
artifacts. This URL redirects to a signed Azure Blob Storage URL
which fails when we include the auth header. This change removes
the auth header, fixing all of the prerelease-registry URLs
generated by PRs.

fix: Do not show unnecessary errors during watch rebuilds

When Pages is used in conjunction with a full stack framework, the framework
build will temporarily remove files that are being watched by Pages, such as
`_worker.js` and `_routes.json`.
Previously we would display errors for these changes, which adds confusing and excessive messages to the Pages dev output. Now builds are skipped if a watched `_worker.js` or `_routes.json` is removed.

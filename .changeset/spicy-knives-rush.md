"wrangler": patch
---

feature: Adds a `--plugin` option to `wrangler pages functions build` which compiles a Pages Plugin. More information about Pages Plugins can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/plugins/). This wrangler build is required for both the development of, and inclusion of, plugins.

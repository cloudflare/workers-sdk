fix: link to the issue chooser in GitHub

Previously, when an error occurs, wrangler says:

> If you think this is a bug then please create an issue at https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/new.

Now, it links through to the issue template chooser which is more helpful.

Fixes [#1169](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/1169)

Enable support for `wrangler dev` on Workers behind Cloudflare Access, utilising `cloudflared`. If you don't have `cloudflared` installed, Wrangler will prompt you to install it. If you _do_, then the first time you start developing using `wrangler dev` your default browser will open with a Cloudflare Access prompt.

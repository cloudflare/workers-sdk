chore: Normalize some dependencies in workers-sdk

This is the first of a few expected patches that normalize dependency versions, This normalizes `undici`, `concurrently`, `@types/node`, `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `eslint`, `typescript`. There are no functional code changes (but there are a couple of typecheck fixes).

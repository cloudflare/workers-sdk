feature: add more types that get logged via `console` methods

This PR adds more special logic for some data types that get logged via `console` methods. Types like `Promise`, `Date`, `WeakMaps`, and some more, now get logged correctly (or at least, better than they used to).

This PR also fixes a sinister bug - the `type` of the `ConsoleAPICalled` events don't match 1:1 with actual console methods (eg: `console.warn` message type is `warning`). This PR adds a mapping between those types and method names. Some methods don't seem to have a message type, I'm not sure why, but we'll get to them later.

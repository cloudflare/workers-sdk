Fix: Upgraded to ES2022 for improved compatibility
Upgraded worker code target version from ES2020 to ES2022 for better compatibility and unblocking of a workaround related to [issue #2029](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/2029). The worker runtime now uses the same V8 version as recent Chrome and is 99% ES2016+ compliant. The only thing we don't support on the Workers runtime, the remaining 1%, is the ES2022 RegEx feature as seen in the compat table for the latest Chrome version.

[resolves #2716](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/2716)

fix: custom builds should allow multiple commands

We were running custom builds as a regular command with `execa`. This would fail whenever we tried to run compound commands like `cargo install -q worker-build && worker-build --release` (via https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/236). The fix is to use `shell: true`, so that the command is run in a shell and can thus use bash-y syntax like `&&`, and so on. I also switched to using `execaCommand` which splits a command string into parts correctly by itself.

fix: make sure that all C3 projects include in their `.gitignore` the wrangler files

Previously only the worker templates included in their `.gitignore` the wrangler files (those being `.dev.vars` and `.wrangler`). Make sure to instead include such files in the `.gitignore` files of all the templates including the full stack ones.

"wrangler": patch
---

patch: This release fixes some regressions related to running `wrangler dev` that were caused by internal refactoring of the dev server architecture ([#3960](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/3960)). The change has been reverted, and will be added back in a future release.

feature: add `deployment view` and `deployment rollbak` subcommands

`deployment view <deployment-id>` will get the details of a deployment, including bindings and usage model information. When using the `--content` option, the command will return the script content for that deployment.
This information can be used to help debug bad deployments or get insights on changes between deployments.

`deployment rollback [deployment-id]` will rollback to a specific deployment in the runtime. This will be useful in situations like recovering from a bad
deployment quickly while resolving issues. If a deployment id is not specified wrangler will rollback to the previous deployment. This rollback only changes the code in the runtime and doesn't affect any code or configurations
in a developer's local setup.

example of `view <deployment-id>` output:

```ts

feat: `wrangler secret * --local`

This PR implements `wrangler secret` for `--local` mode. The implementation is simply a no-op, since we don't want to actually write secret values to disk (I think?). I also got the messaging for remote mode right by copying from wrangler 1. Further, I added tests for all the `wrangler secret` commands.

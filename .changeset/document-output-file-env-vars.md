"wrangler": patch

Command descriptions now include information about capturing deployment output using the WRANGLER_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH and WRANGLER_OUTPUT_FILE_DIRECTORY environment variables. This documentation appears in the help text for `wrangler deploy`, `wrangler versions upload`, `wrangler versions deploy`, and `wrangler pages deploy` commands.

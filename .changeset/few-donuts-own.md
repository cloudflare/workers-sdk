Display a more helpful error when trying to publish to a route in use by another worker.

Previously, when trying to publish a worker to a route that was in use by another worker,
there would be a really unhelpful message about a failed API call. Now, there's a much
nicer message that tells you what worker is running on that route, and gives you a link
to the workers overview page so you can unassign it if you want.

✘ [ERROR] Can't publish a worker to routes that are assigned to another worker.

  "test-custom-routes-redeploy" is already assigned to route
  test-custom-worker.swag.lgbt

  Unassign other workers from the routes you want to publish to, and then try again.

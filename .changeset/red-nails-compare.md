feat: CodeCov Integration
CodeCov is used for analyzing code and tests to improve stability and maintainability. It does this by utilizing static code analysis
and testing output to provide insights into things that need improving, security concerns, missing test coverage of critical code, and more,
which can be missed even after exhaustive human review.

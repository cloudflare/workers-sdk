feat: autogenerated config from dash

Makes `wrangler init`'s `--from-dash` option pull in data from Cloudflare's dashboard to generate a wrangler.toml file populated with configuration from an existing Worker.
This is a first step towards making `wrangler init` more useful for folks who are already using Cloudflare's products on the Dashboard.

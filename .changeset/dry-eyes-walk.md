fix: Respect querystring params when calling `.fetch` on a worker instantiated with `unstable_dev`

Previously, querystring params would be stripped, causing issues for test cases that depended on them. For example, given the following worker script:

```js
export default {
	fetch(req) {
		const url = new URL(req.url);
		const name = url.searchParams.get("name");
		return new Response("Hello, " + name);
	},
};
```

would fail the following test case:

```js
const worker = await unstable_dev("script.js");
const res = await worker.fetch("http://worker?name=Walshy");
const text = await res.text();
// Following fails, as returned text is 'Hello, null'
expect(text).toBe("Hello, Walshy");
```

Only commit on C3 initialized repositories

Currently C3 generates a commit independently on whether it initialized the git repository or not,
this has some negative implications (such as people not expecting such commits and getting surprised
by them or potentially incorrect commits applied in monorepos), so instead of always committing these
changes make it so that C3 commits only when the git repo was generated by C3 itself, aligning it more
with what looks like the general behavior of such type of CLIs

feat: Sites support for local mode `wrangler dev`

This adds support for Workers Sites in local mode when running wrangler `dev`. Further, it fixes a bug where we were sending the `__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST` definition as a separate module even with service worker format, and a bug where we weren't uploading the namespace binding when other kv namespaces weren't present.

Add `wrangler auth token` command to retrieve the current OAuth token, refreshing it if necessary. This is similar to `gh auth token` in the GitHub CLI and allows users to easily retrieve their authentication token for use with other tools and scripts without having to manually locate the config file or handle token refresh.

feat: add CLI flag and config key for experimental Workers + Assets

This change adds a new experimental CLI flag (`--experimental-assets`) and configuration key (`experimental_assets`) for the new Workers + Assets work.

The new flag and configuration key are for the time being "inactive", in the sense that no behaviour is attached to them yet. This will follow up in future work.

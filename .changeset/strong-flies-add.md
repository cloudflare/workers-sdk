fix: fix `dev` and `publish`

We introduced some bugs in recent PRs

- In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/196, we broke being able to pass an entrypoint directly to the cli. In this PR, I just reverted that fix. I'll reopen https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/issues/78 and we'll tackle it again later. (cc @jgentes)
- In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/215, we broke being able to publish a script by just passing `--latest` or `--compatibility-data` in the cli. This PR fixes that by reading the correct argument when choosing whether to publish.
- In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/247, we broke how we made requests by passing headers to requests. This PR reverts the changes made in `cfetch/internal.ts`. (cc @petebacondarwin)
- In https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2/pull/244, we broke `dev` and it would immediately crash. This PR fixes the reference in `dev.tsx` that was breaking. (cc @petebacondarwin)

Bump the version of `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` in the hello-world templates from `^0.8.19` to `^0.12.4`

The version of the `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` in the hello-world templates is currently `^0.8.19`, since the package is pre v1, the Caret syntax only installs the latest `0.8.x` version of the package, which is a bit outdated. So the changes here manually keep the package more up to date.
